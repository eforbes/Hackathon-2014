The program in anthropology, offering a Bachelor of Arts degree, is designed to provide
students with a strong general background in anthropology preparatory to graduate
studies or employment in fields such as qualitative and applied research, archaeology,
foreign relations, international business, international law, and social work. The
curriculum requires all students, under the supervision of an anthropology faculty
member, to complete a research project in some area of the student’s interest.
Individual counseling is provided for all students.
Lower division work in anthropology emphasizes the four major divisions of the
discipline: physical anthropology, archaeology, cultural anthropology, and linguistics.
Upper division courses emphasize archaeology and cultural anthropology, with
supporting courses in physical anthropology and linguistics offered at the junior level.

<i>
<b>Learning Objectives </b>
</i>

There are three learning objectives for anthropology students. The first is career and
academic preparation, enabling students successfully to pursue higher degrees in their
chosen specialties. The second learning objective is intensive exposure to human
diversity, past and present, physical and cultural. This directly supports the third
objective, which is to prepare all students to understand and function in an increasingly
interconnected world.

The mission of the School of Art is to create a stimulating environment for the practice,
understanding and advancement of the visual arts.
The mission is carried out by:
•  Providing students with a thorough understanding of artistic traditions past and
present to help them find their place in contemporary artistic practices;
•  Encouraging the exploration of innovative artistic techniques and practices in an
interdisciplinary environment; and
•  Helping students develop sound studio practices by encouraging active
involvement in the community.
Our strategic priorities are:
•  Cultivating students, faculty, staff and administrators who promote the visual arts
as central to culture;
•  Maintaining a rigorous yet flexible curriculum that stimulates critical thinking and
promotes technical expertise; and
•  Investing in facilities and technology that support our mission.
The program in art offers the Bachelor of Fine Arts and the Bachelor of Arts degrees in
art with emphases in the studio areas of ceramics, sculpture, graphic design, painting,
photography, digital media, and printmaking, and the Bachelor of Arts degree in the
academic area of art history. The curriculum for all degrees allows students to develop
critical thinking skills and technical expertise in an interdisciplinary environment.
The Bachelor of Fine Arts in art degree enables students to enter professional careers
in art and to find their place in contemporary artistic practice. It is the degree most
often required for admission to graduate programs offering the Master of Fine Arts
degree, which is the most accepted terminal degree in art and the degree required for
college-level teaching.
The Bachelor of Arts in art degree certifies that the student has completed a major
study in the visual arts as an integral part of a general liberal arts degree program. Career
preparation is not the primary objective of the Bachelor of Arts degree; however, it
ensures that the student has a broad approach to artistic production.

<b>School of Art </b>





Teacher certification in art education may be acquired through the Oklahoma State
Department of Education by combining the Bachelor of Fine Arts or Bachelor of Arts
program with a second major in education.  The requirements for a major in education
may be found beginning on page 128 of this <i>Bulletin</i>.
The Bachelor of Arts in art history offers the student general knowledge about art
through the ages and the critical skills to interpret it. This degree prepares the student
for entry-level careers in museums, galleries, and arts organizations, in art publishing,
and for admission to graduate programs in art history, art conservation and museum
studies. The degree also equips students with the critical reading and thinking, visual
analysis, and writing skills to pursue a wide range of other careers.

<i>
<b>Admission </b>
</i>

There is no portfolio admission for students who enter the University at the freshman
level and wish to pursue the Bachelor of Fine Arts and Bachelor in Arts in art degrees.
All transfer students to the studio art program must submit a portfolio of work for
review by the faculty member in the area of emphasis, and acceptance is based on that
portfolio review.

<i>
<b>General Requirements </b>
</i>

Students pursuing the Bachelor of Fine Arts or Bachelor of Arts in art complete the
four core course requirements before taking intermediary and upper division courses. In
the core courses, students learn basic skills about art-making and develop sound studio
practices. The courses form the foundation that will support students as they work
towards designing a curriculum in their areas of emphasis.
Students pursuing the Bachelor of Arts in art history complete the two introductory
courses before choosing from a broad range of upper division courses. Students are
encouraged to study abroad and to pursue internships in their areas of study.

<i>
<b>Learning Objectives </b>
</i>


<b>Program Objective 1. </b>Students who complete the undergraduate program will
demonstrate competency in the practice of discipline-based studio areas.
a.  Develop the expressive aspects of art (realizing creative ideas in visual form and
developing a body of work illustrating those creative ideas).
b.  Develop the conceptual aspects of art (producing quality work that exhibits
original concepts and is consistent with those concepts).
c.  Develop the formal and technical aspects of art (illustrating a mastery of materials
and tools, and having a grasp of how to use and manipulate formal elements and
composition for an intended effect).

<b>Program Objective 2.</b> Students who complete the undergraduate program will engage
in art critical and art historical thinking and writing.
a.  Articulate ideas and concepts about art in the classroom, during critical discourse.
b.  Conduct historical or critical research on art and express the outcome of that
research in writing (engaging with art historical or critical methodologies and
writing in standard English).

<b>Program Objective 3: </b>Students who complete the undergraduate program will produce
academic, studio, and commercial portfolios needed to succeed in the job market
and/or in graduate school programs.

The communication program’s strong liberal arts orientation equips students for a
variety of professional opportunities in communication as well as graduate study in
communication, law, business administration, and other areas. With appropriately
chosen electives, students can prepare themselves for careers in media studies, public
relations, advertising, journalism, visual studies, and related fields.
Students pursuing a major in communication typically choose the B.A. degree.
Communication majors who wish to choose the B.S. degree must petition the faculty
chair for permission.
The three core courses in the major provide a strong background in communication,
covering topics ranging from symbolic processes and systems to theories and
philosophy of communication research. Majors also choose three of the four
foundation courses that emphasize the larger social consequences of communication.
Working with their advisors, communication majors develop an 18-hour emphasis in a
particular area of the discipline. Communication majors may, with the approval of their
advisor, develop their own individualized emphasis in communication.

<i>
<b>Learning Objectives </b>
</i>

Students who complete the undergraduate program in communication are expected to
be able to:
•  Evaluate and critique the central theoretical concepts in the study of
communication;
•  Use and understand basic social science methodologies;
•  Effectively use writing to convey their ideas;
•  Demonstrate a basic competence in oral communication;
•  Critically engage with the world of visual and digital communication; and

The faculty of the Department of Communication Disorders offer curricula leading to
the Bachelor of Arts in Deaf Education (B.A.D.E.) and the Bachelor of Science in
Speech-language Pathology (B.S.S.P.). The mission of the Department of
Communication Disorders is to provide challenging academic coursework, clinical
experiences, and research opportunities for students pursuing professional careers in
speech-language pathology and deaf education.
These programs combine a broad liberal arts undergraduate curriculum with strong
academic coursework and practicum opportunities as a background for the management
of communication disorders. The deaf education program focuses on preparing teachers
of deaf and hard of hearing students. The program in speech-language pathology
prepares students for graduate study since the master’s degree is the entry level into the
profession.

<i>
<b>Certification </b>
</i>

The programs in speech-language pathology and deaf education are recognized by the
Oklahoma Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability and are fully
accredited by the State of Oklahoma. The speech-language pathology program prepares
students for certification by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association
(ASHA) upon completion of the master’s degree. The degree program in deaf education
leads to state teacher certification by the State of Oklahoma and national certification by
the Council on Education of the Deaf (CED) and Teacher Education Accreditation
Council (TEAC).

<i>
<b>Admission/Retention Requirements </b>
</i>

Students qualifying for admission to the University may enter either of these programs.
Retention requires majors to earn a grade of at least C in all program courses taken.
Courses may be repeated, if necessary, to meet this requirement. Students with a grade
point average lower than 3.0 in speech-language pathology courses will enroll in clinical
practicum if recommended by faculty. Failure to pass the practicum course will result in
non-recommendation for graduate study in speech-language pathology study.
Admission to the master’s program in speech-language pathology at The University of
Tulsa is not guaranteed to undergraduate majors.

<b>Communication Disorders </b>





<i>
<b>The Tulsa Curriculum </b>
</i>

The Tulsa Curriculum is designed to help students understand and appreciate several
areas of knowledge in addition to a specialty. To meet specific certification
requirements, speech-language pathology majors take PSY 3063 and/or EDUC 3713
and ANTH 2023 (Block II). Students receiving the Bachelor of Science in Speech-
language Pathology (B.S.S.P.) must also take a First Seminar and complete a formal
writing course (ENGL 1033), a mathematics course (MATH 1083 or 1093), a basic
course in statistics (PSY 2023, SOC 2023, or STAT 2013), one course in a biological
science, and one course in a physical science. Speech-language pathology students must
also take the Senior Seminar class offered by the department.

<i>
<b>Deaf Education </b>

The deaf education program prepares teachers of students who are deaf or hard-of-
hearing (HH), leading to N-12 certification from the Oklahoma Commission for
Educational Quality and Accountability in the area of Deaf/HH. The program is
accredited by the Council on Education of the Deaf (CED) as a comprehensive
program. Therefore, students take courses in American Sign Language as well as courses
focusing on auditory-oral approaches. In addition to the deaf education course

The Department of Educational Studies seeks to advance theory, research, and
scholarship in the field of education. The faculty accomplishes this through individual
and collaborative research and writing projects, and through aiding students to think
critically about education. We conceive of education broadly; faculty and students focus
on questions including (but not limited to) the aims and purposes of education and the
nature of learners and learning institutions and contexts. The approach of the
department is multi-disciplinary and involves scholarship in fields such as philosophy,
psychology, anthropology, sociology, history, and political science. In addition, we are
linked with the larger educational community, locally and internationally, in service of
practice and policy.

“Urban Education” is representative of the <i>best</i> educational research and applied
practices available in the field today. Issues of race, gender, socio-economic class, equity,
linguistic pluralism, and social justice can be found in every classroom whether urban,
suburban, rural, public or private. The <i>degree</i> to which these factors can be found in a
school is the only difference.
The mission of the School of Urban Education is to develop transformative
professional educators who are:
•  Subject matter experts;
•  Practicing scholars of educational research;
•  Ethical, dedicated representatives of the profession; and
•  Equipped to advance every child’s learning amid the social, economic and cultural
diversity found in the classroom and surrounding community.
Cultural philosopher and educator Henry Giroux (1943- ) defines a “transformative
educator” as one who “has a social vision and commitment to make public schools
democratic public spheres, where all children, regardless of race, class, gender and age
can learn what it means to be able to participate fully in a society that affirms and
sustains the principles of equality, freedom, and social justice and who has the courage
to take risks, to look into the future and to imagine a world that could be, as opposed to
simply what is.”<i/>

To achieve the goal of developing transformative professional educators, there will be
early and extensive clinical opportunities for the student intern to be active in a
partnership with a specific school. Research indicates that, just as with the medical
profession, the more hours spent in the clinical experience to apply content knowledge
and practices, the better prepared the intern will be for transition to career
responsibilities.
Learning to integrate technology into classrooms is a fundamental component of the
teacher preparation program. In addition to standard uses of technology tools, there will
be the opportunity to understand and assist the progress of students in a classroom
through software analysis, applications of various social media and interpretation and
uses of data to advance learning.
All education courses taken by student teaching interns will stress the relevance of the
course content to classroom applications as demonstrated by on-site projects with
partner schools whenever possible.

<b>School of Urban Education </b>

The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree is offered by the faculty of the Department of
English. The aim of the undergraduate major in English is to educate students in
literature and language and in the practice of writing, and to enhance their
understanding of the tradition of liberal arts. The major develops the ability to
understand and appreciate literature in its historical and cultural contexts, to read closely
and analytically in a broad range of texts, and to write about language and literature with
clarity and precision.
The English core emphasizes basic experiences of the literary tradition in England
and America and introduces students to critical methods and theoretical approaches to
literary study. On this foundation, English electives focus on literary periods, major
literary figures, the several genres of literature, and the nature and history of the English
language. Work in related areas such as foreign languages, philosophy, history, film
studies, and creative writing is encouraged. The overall aim of the program is flexible,
yet directive and cumulative, and provides broad opportunities for professional as well
as personal post-graduate application.

<i>
<b>Learning Objectives:  </b>
</i>

•  To facilitate student learning by providing knowledge, resources, and challenges for
their growth;
•  To expose students to unfamiliar literary works (including film, digital media, and
other narrative and poetic forms), as well as to canonical or traditional texts;
•  To improve student reading, writing, and thinking through careful practice with
frequent and substantial feedback from faculty;
•  To cultivate in students a strong sense of curiosity and desire to learn; and
•  To serve and reach the community through our graduates, programs, events, and
continuing education.

Chad Settle, Economics
The environmental policy major is an interdisciplinary program in environmental
studies. It rests on the premise that students must be able to combine an understanding
of the scientific basis for environmental problems with knowledge of human needs,
history, politics, and economics to derive practical solutions to environmental issues.
Correspondingly, course work involves classes with environmental scholars in various
natural science, social science, and humanities departments. While providing a rigorous
and broad educational experience, the major also allows students to custom design an
area of strength using elective course work.
Students are encouraged to use an internship or study abroad as a capstone
experience for the major. Both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees are
offered. In addition to the differences in core requirements, note the differences in
MATH and STAT requirements below.
Students majoring in environmental policy should carefully note the prerequisites
listed below and plan the use of their elective courses accordingly. Planning in
conjunction with the program advisors is highly recommended.

<i>
<b>Course Requirements </b>
</i>

The Bachelor of Arts in environmental policy requires a minimum of 35 hours in the

The history major exposes students to a range of historical issues and problems, and
develops the fundamental skills necessary to the practice of the historian’s craft. It
allows a level of specialization that promotes an appreciation of the complexity of
human affairs and the difficulties involved in their interpretation. The history major
challenges the intellect, inspires the imagination, and stimulates analytical thinking.
Historical knowledge provides a valuable background for students considering careers
in law, journalism, library and museum work, education, business, and local, state,
national, and international public service. Students of history contribute anywhere that a
knowledge of domestic and foreign affairs is required, and, of course, to the profession
of historical research and teaching.

<i>
<b>Learning Objectives </b>
</i>

•  Demonstrate understanding in several areas of history;
•  Demonstrate a range of critical thinking skills transferable to a wide range of
careers;
•  Demonstrate an appreciation of the complexity of human affairs and the
difficulties involved in their interpretation; and
•  Perform research and demonstrate oral and written communication skills.

<i>
<b>Major Requirements </b>
</i>

A minimum of 33 credit hours in history courses, excluding history courses taken to
meet general curriculum requirements, is required for the Bachelor of Arts in history.
No more than 39 credit hours may be credited toward that degree.

<b>Lower Division Requirements </b>

Three courses at the 2000 level. Of these three courses, three different fields must be
represented. Majors are to select three fields from among the following:
Ancient (Mediterranean and Near East, China and Japan, the Americas)
Modern World (China and Japan, the Americas, Piratica)
U.S. (U.S., Native America, U.S. and the World)
Europe and Russia (Medieval and Modern)

<b>
</b>


<b/>


<b>History </b>




<b>Upper Division Requirements </b>

HIST 3903, History Colloquium (This course must be taken directly after declaring
the history major.)
Seven courses at the 3000- and 4000-level. Of these seven courses, at least three
different fields must be represented. Majors are to select three fields from among
the following:
Greece and Rome
China and Japan
Europe and Russia
U.S.
The Americas
plus
One 4000-level seminar

<i>
<b>Minor in History </b>
</i>

A minor in history is available. Twelve credit hours must be completed in history with
six hours at the 3000 level or higher.

<i>
<b>Combined Bachelor of Arts/Master of Arts Program </b>
</i>

The combined Bachelor of Arts/Master of Arts program enables highly motivated
students to earn a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in five years. The combined program
requires the same number of credits and level of work as the current Bachelor of Arts
and Master of Arts (thesis option) degree programs. As a result only students who enter
TU with an IB diploma or at least 24 hours of AP credit can reasonably be expected to
complete both degrees in five years. All students admitted to the combined B.A./M.A.
program will write a master’s thesis as part of their program of study.
With instructor’s permission, undergraduate students enrolled in the B.A./M.A.
program may take 5000 level courses listed below.
The typical student will apply for admission to the combined program in his or her
junior year. (For more information, see the <i>Graduate Bulletin</i>.) Students interested in the
combined B.A./M.A. should contact the graduate advisor or any faculty member of the
Department of History to find out more about the program.

Students who fulfill the requirements for a major in the Department of Languages
acquire greater awareness of and appreciation for other cultures; develop proficiency in
a target language and a basic understanding of its linguistic structure; gain a deeper
understanding of textual analysis and literary genres, styles, and periods; engage with
current scholarship; and prepare themselves to participate in a global society. Majoring
in a language provides students with a strong pre-professional background for graduate
studies in the arts and humanities as well as for careers in business, teaching, and
government.
The first and second-year language courses offered by the Department of Languages
are designed to help students throughout the University develop intermediate-level
proficiency in a second language, as specified in the American Council on the Teaching
of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) guidelines. Students enrolled in these courses likewise
gain insights into other cultures.

<i>
<b>Placement in Language Courses </b>
</i>

Prior to coming to campus to enroll, incoming students with previous classroom or life
experience in Chinese, French, German, or Spanish who intend to continue studying
the same language must take its placement exam. This policy also applies to native
speakers of a Romance language who intend to take courses either in their native tongue
or in another language taught by the department. The placement examination does not
grant academic credit, nor can it be used to test out of the language proficiency
requirement.

<i>
<b>Delayed Proficiency Credit </b>
</i>

By petitioning the Department of Languages, students who begin their language study
in a course above the level of first semester and complete it with a grade of C or higher
receive credit for the previous course as well, up to and including fourth semester. Such
credit may not exceed four hours. Students with previous college, AP, or IB credit in a

<b>Languages </b>





language are not eligible for delayed proficiency credit in that language, nor are native
speakers who choose to study their native language. Delayed proficiency credit is
awarded toward the completion of a College’s language proficiency requirement, but it
is not granted if the language is being taken as an elective.

<i>
<b>Beginning and Intermediate Language Courses </b>
</i>

Students whose College requirements or personal goals include one or two years of
language study may select from Chinese, French, German, ancient Greek, Hebrew,
Latin, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. The first course in each language sequence has
no prerequisite and assumes no prior knowledge of the language. Each subsequent
course in the beginning and intermediate sequences has as its prerequisite a grade of C
or higher in the previous course or its equivalent, or departmental approval through
placement. Students who elect to repeat a 1000- or 2000-level language course for a
higher grade may do so only in the most advanced course they have taken in the
sequence, and they may not take language courses out of sequence.

<i>
<b>Study Abroad </b>
</i>

As a significant component for the college experience, every language student is
encouraged to participate in a study abroad program to acquire cultural literacy and
fluency in a foreign language. For more details on TU’s programs abroad, contact the
Center for Global Education (CGE) at 918-631-3229 or visit

<i>www.utulsa.edu/globaleducation</i>.

<i>
<b>Related Studies </b>
</i>

Courses in comparative literature are taught in English and have no prerequisites. These
draw from various traditions and time periods and provide strategies for relating
literature to such areas as psychology, philosophy, politics, cinema, and the literatures of
other cultures. The faculty of the Department of Languages also offers a variety of
courses in areas such as linguistics, classics, film studies, and women’s and gender
studies. Many of these are taught in English and are appropriate for students in a wide
range of fields.

<i>
<b>Language Majors </b>
</i>

Major programs are offered in Chinese studies, French, German, Russian studies, and
Spanish. The curriculum of a language major provides a wide range of experiences
inside and outside the classroom. Many students combine their language major with a
concentration in an additional field. Such a concentration may be a minor, a certificate
program, or a second major. Prospective language teachers complete the major in
Chinese studies, French, German, Russian studies, or Spanish, along with the licensure
and certification requirements for grades K-12 as determined by the School of Urban
Education (see page 128).



<i>
<b/>
</i>




<i>
<b>Learning Objectives </b>
</i>

Learning objectives at all levels of languages programs are met through students’
demonstration of the following:
•  Language skills (reading, listening, speaking, and writing) that aid in communication
and understanding among persons and groups of different linguistic and cultural
backgrounds;
•  Critical thinking and creative insights in the disciplined study of cultural media
(such as literature and film) and linguistics;
•  Fluency and coherence when presenting ideas in writing and in speech.

<i>
<b>Bachelor of Science in International Business and Language </b>
</i>

Career goals that include both language and business may be realized through the
Bachelor of Science in International Business and Language (B.S.I.B.L.) degree offered
through the Collins College of Business and described beginning on page 283. This
single major combines specialized training in international business with the Chinese
studies, French, German, Russian studies, or Spanish major curriculum.

<i>
<b>Chinese Studies Major </b>
</i>

The Chinese Studies major is an interdisciplinary program drawing from the disciplines of
political science, history, literature and language, business, and economics to prepare
students for a variety of professional careers and academic programs related to China.
See

<i>
<b>Bachelor of Arts in Spanish </b>

The Culture of Spain (SPAN 3013), Latin American Cultures (SPAN 3023), or Spanish
Film (SPAN 3333), by completing the equivalent of one of these courses during a study
abroad experience, or by enrolling in an approved “Language Intensive” class offered
outside of the Department of Languages in which a significant portion of the
coursework is completed in Spanish. Although students who choose the “Language
Intensive” option fulfill the culture requirement, the course itself does not count toward
the major. Spanish education majors take Methods of Teaching Languages (LANG
4003) as part of their major, or Spanish majors may take LANG 4003 in place of a
3000-level elective course.

<i>
<b>Language Minors </b>
</i>

Students may minor in classics, or a language (Chinese, French, German, ancient Greek,
Latin, Russian, or Spanish), with the approval of the major department. A minor in
Chinese, French, German, ancient Greek, Latin, or Russian consists of a total of 12
hours at the 3000 and 4000 levels. LANG 4003 does not count toward the minor. The
minor in Spanish consists of 15 credits at the 3000-level and above, including at least
one course at the 4000 level.

<i>
<b>Minor in Linguistics</b>

The School of Music, School of Art, and Department of Theatre form the Division of
Fine and Performing Arts, which offers programs that lead to professional careers in the
arts and to the appreciation of the fine and performing arts. The mission of the School
of Music is to provide its students with a professional musical education that is
consistent with the aims of a comprehensive university and relevant to a continually
changing global and technological environment, to enrich the University’s curriculum
with course offerings and ensemble experiences available to all students, and to enhance
campus and community life with quality concerts, recitals, and other programs and
performances.
The School of Music offers both liberal arts and professional degree programs. The
Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree is offered in general music studies. In cooperation with
the School of Art, the Department of Theatre and the Department of Communication,
the Bachelor of Arts degree is also offered with a major in arts management.
The Bachelor of Music (B.M.) degree is offered with majors in performance and in
music composition.
The Bachelor of Music Education (B.M.E.) is offered in instrumental and vocal
music.
A student may elect course offerings in jazz literature and techniques in any of the

<b>School of Music </b>





B.A. majors in music may receive a minor in film scoring by completing the
requirements on page XX of this <i>Bulletin</i>. B.A. Music and B.M. Composition majors
may elect a film scoring emphasis by completing the requirements on page XX of this

<i>Bulletin</i>.

<i>
<b>Admission to the Music Major </b>
</i>

Students who wish to major in music in pursuit of the B.A., the B.M., or the B.M.E.
degrees must first audition. The audition serves two purposes. It determines both 1)
eligibility for admission to the music major, and 2) qualification for music grants-in-aid
for both prospective music majors and non-majors who wish to participate in music
performance groups. At the time of audition, a committee of faculty members
determines whether a candidate qualifies for acceptance into the music major. Students
who qualify to major in music through successful audition are notified in writing of
both their admission to the major and their financial award. Students who do not intend
to major in music, but who qualify for grant-in-aid, are notified in writing of both their
financial award and the performance expectations associated with that award.
Both prospective music majors and currently enrolled students seeking to add the
music major must perform an audition. If a student is taking lessons in the School of
Music, the end-of-semester jury may constitute the required audition.
In the event that a student does not qualify for acceptance, a member of faculty of
the School of Music will discuss other degree plans to be considered, or any steps that
could be made towards admission to the music major at a later date.

<i>
<b>Entrance Auditions Overview</b>
</i>

Auditions for students entering as freshman are held in late January and early February
of each academic year. Specific audition dates may be obtained by contacting the School
of Music office. Students audition for faculty members in their specific performance
areas. For instance, pianists audition for the piano faculty; and clarinetists audition for
the woodwind faculty. Each audition concludes with an informal interview that gives
the faculty members an opportunity to learn about the student’s interests and goals.
Students are strongly encouraged to audition in person on the posted audition dates.
Alternative audition dates and times are arranged only if conflicts with posted dates are
unavoidable. Audition appointments may be requested by sending an email to
musicauditions@utulsa.edu
or to a faculty member in the student’s performance area.
Audition appointments may also be made by calling the School of Music at 918-631-
2262.
The faculty in each instrumental and vocal area has specified music that is appropriate
for auditions. To view this repertoire, please refer to the audition information on the
School of Music website at

•  The ability to read, analyze, and perform notated music on one or more principal
instruments;
•  The ability to discuss and distinguish between various musical styles and genres and
to understand their cultural sources;

<i>
<b>Special Regulations and Information </b>
</i>

precision, and to undertake graduate and professional studies.

<i>

•  To probe the central problems and issues that have shaped Western thought;
•  To cultivate skills of analysis and logical argument in written and oral presentation;
and
•  To prepare students for future studies, graduate or professional.

<i>
<b>Major Subject </b>

There are myriad ways in which political ideas, political institutions, and political
processes touch and mold our lives, but typically this dimension of society is little
noticed and nearly invisible when things are going well or appear normal. However,
when the world is in turmoil, in recession or depression, caught up in war or in need of
new leaders, laws, and practices, politics makes itself felt. At this moment politics
appears everywhere and intrudes upon everything. It emerges as the now-visible set of
causes that structures and establishes the tone for our collective existence together.
We study political science not so much because it is a science. It is a science but in
addition to that, it is a source for hints, suggestions, and direction that might begin to
explain what politics has to do with the turmoil we feel around us. We look for insight
into the ideas that have set the ideological agenda and for insight into the challenger
ideas hidden in the long history of our societies. We are on the track of insight into the
contingent facts of institutions and their development that could have turned out
differently than they did, and which may someday change again, for good or for ill. We
seek insight into the intersecting causes that frame conflict and cooperation, whether on
the global or the local scale.
Turmoil exposes the background machinery that creates, sustains, or destroys
arrangements of power and relationships of authority. It raises questions about what is
possible in a given space of power. It shows us why political ideals depend for their
realization on the times in which we live and how time both renews and erodes ideals
and the practices in which they are embodied.
Even in normal times, political insight is useful. Scientific research itself is heavily
indebted to the political structures that fund it and to the public opinion that supports
funding. We need insight into how this works. A democratic society is a wonderful
engine of dynamic innovation, but this very fact creates social and economic
instabilities. For some, precious customs are constantly under challenge and politics
provides insight into their conservation. For others, change is desired and analyses of
power and authority will enable them to establish strategies for transformation. The
liberties which the ideals of our society uphold require citizens who have studied their
meaning and place, or else they will have no traction upon on our actual lives.

<b>Political Science </b>





As no career is untouched by politics, political science also makes a good second
major and a good minor. For majors, political science is one of the grand entrances into
law, government service, and teaching. It is also critical for anyone who expects to join a
not-for-profit agency or a for-profit corporation that is impacted by domestic political
processes or by international events.<i>
<b/>
</i>


<i>
<b>Learning Objectives </b>
</i>

•  Students who complete the undergraduate program in political science will be able
to evaluate political ideas, institutions and processes within states and in a global
context.
•  Students will have an in depth knowledge of at least one of the following subfields:
American politics, international studies, and political and legal theory.
•  Students will be able to demonstrate critical thinking skills and the ability to defend
a thesis in written and oral format.
Students from the American politics subfield will be able to:
•  Demonstrate substantial knowledge of current political and governmental
structures and processes in the United States;

cultural, and historical contexts in which they were formed; and
•  Comprehend the history and meaning of American political ideas, being especially
attentive to the ideological conflicts that have characterized our political history.
Students from the international studies subfield will be able to:
•  Demonstrate a familiarity with the main theoretical perspectives that facilitate an
understanding of politics within and among states;
•  Recognize the patterns of interaction among actors of the global community and
have an informed awareness of the structural, social, economic, and political factors
that shape those interactions; and
•  Understand in a comparative context the political structures, institutions, governing
processes, and cultures of a diverse selection of developed and developing
countries.
Students from the political and legal theory subfield will be able to:
•  Demonstrate familiarity and engagement with the great thinkers and political ideas
that have shaped the development of political life in the West for over 2500 years;
•  Be aware of contemporary debates about recurrently contested political ideas, such
as equality, liberty, virtue, tolerance, and justice; and

The aims of the undergraduate major in psychology are several:
•  To develop a scientific understanding of human behavior and experience, to
develop critical thinking skills;
•  To learn how psychological knowledge is generated; and
•  To apply psychological principles to the solution of human problems.
A student who completes the psychology curriculum receives a Bachelor of Arts or
Bachelor of Science degree and preparation for a career in teaching, business, or law, as
well as for graduate work in clinical, applied, or academic psychology. A psychology
minor complements any line of study. Psychology courses also contribute to a major in
organizational studies, a minor in early childhood intervention, and the major and minor
in women’s and gender studies. The Department of Psychology  is also part of two
interdisciplinary institutes: the Institute for Biochemical and Psychological Study of
Individual Differences and The University of Tulsa Institute for Trauma, Adversity, and
Justice. Psychology majors are encouraged to take part in activities beyond their formal
course work such as participating in faculty research labs and institutes, engaging in
independent research projects, departmental colloquia, the Psi Chi National Honor
Society and service learning in community settings.

<i>
<b>Learning Objectives </b>
</i>

Students who complete the undergraduate program will demonstrate a knowledge base
of major experimental findings and theoretical perspectives in psychology.
•  Apply basic research methods, including research design, data analysis, and
interpretation;
•  Pursue post-baccalaureate education or enter the workforce; and
•  Apply psychological principles to personal, social, organizational, and diversity
issues (i.e., Identify appropriate applications of psychology in solving problems
such as the origins and treatment of abnormal behavior, tests and measurement,
and psychology-based interventions while recognizing the sociocultural contexts
that influence individual differences in beliefs, values, and interactions.).<i>

<i>
<b>Requirements for the Psychology Major </b>
</i>

The Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in psychology require a total of 36 credit
hours in psychology, excluding those counted toward general curriculum requirements.
The Bachelor of Arts requires the equivalent of four semesters of foreign language. The
Bachelor of Science requires the equivalent of math through Calculus I and Calculus II
or Statistics as required in the core curriculum. At least two-thirds of these credit hours
must be 3000- or 4000-level courses, and no more than 39 hours in psychology may be
counted toward the degree. Psychology majors must earn a minimum grade of B in the
four foundation courses. A senior project is also required.  Options that satisfy this
requirement include completing a one- or two-semester research capstone, taking a fifth
core class, completing a 5000-level graduate course, or participating in a psychology
practicum experience. Given that the major allows flexibility, students are strongly urged
to work with their advisors to select courses in a meaningful order and in relation to
their own career plans. However, majors are encouraged to take foundation courses as
early as possible.

People spend their entire lives in social groups and networks, ranging from the family to
global systems. Like anthropologists, sociologists study how these groups and networks
work. (Sociologists focus on industrial and post-industrial societies, while
anthropologists are concerned with human culture in general. Psychologists, in contrast,
study individuals.) Developing the ability to analyze society is a core component of
anyone’s education and personal development, and thus the sociology major facilitates
any career. In addition, sociology majors may design a specific program of study in
preparation for graduate school, professional school (law, business, medicine), and for
careers in social service, government, research, consulting, teaching, or business.
Sociology courses also contribute to specialized certificates in African American and
international studies and the women’s and gender studies major.
The Department of Sociology offers two curriculum options: Bachelor of Arts (B.A.)
or Bachelor of Science (B.S.). Students should consult a sociology faculty advisor to
select the appropriate program.

<i>
<b>Learning Objectives </b>
</i>

•  Critical thinking (synthesize material; assess evidence; reason logically; distinguish
between fact and opinion).
•  Clear and effective writing and speaking.
•  Core concepts (culture , social change, status, norm, socialization, identity,
stratification, social structure, social institutions).
•  Research methods (evaluate evidence; use quantitative and qualitative analysis;
understand ethical issues).

The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in theatre and The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in
musical theatre offer a core curriculum supporting the collaborative process essential to
the living theatre. In consultation with a department advisor, theatre students choose
courses leading to a general education in theatre or an emphasis within the art form.
The student may audition for acceptance into an area of specialization at the end of the
spring semester of their freshman year. Areas of specialization are acting, musical
theatre, design/technical theatre, stage management, playwriting, history and literature,
and directing. The theatre student is expected to participate fully in the production
aspects of the theatre program as the essential laboratory in which course work is
integrated with practice.
The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in musical theatre does not require a minor area
of study since this degree offers three distinct areas of concentration: acting, music, and
dance.
The Department of Theatre offers minors in theatre, musical theatre, and dance.
Permission of the program director is required for all minors. An audition to be
admitted to a minor may also be required. Minors are required to audition and
participate in production aspects of the program.
The Department of Theatre is located in Kendall Hall which houses two theatres, a
CAD design lab, scenery and costume shops, and a dance studio. These facilities enable
students to participate fully in traditional and experimental theatrical productions. The
third venue of the Department of Theatre, the Lorton Performance Center, contains a
state-of-the-art proscenium theatre where musicals, dance concerts, and plays are
presented. The focus of the Department focus on an undergraduate program allows the
serious theatre student multiple opportunities to be produced, both on the mainstage
and in a student-driven studio setting. Students enjoy opportunities to direct, to act in
major roles, to stage manage, and to design and produce original works.
The film studies program, described on page XX of this <i>Bulletin</i>, provides additional
opportunities in performance, writing, and design.
Non-majors are also encouraged to participate in theatre productions and to take
theatre courses. However, priority for placement is given to majors and minors and
space is limited in certain classes.

<b>Director </b>

Holly Laird, English
The program in women’s and gender studies at The University of Tulsa considers how
gender and other intersecting factors, such as race, class, culture, sexuality, and age, have
worked to shape the life experiences of women and men from diverse backgrounds.
The program analyzes the contemporary and historical factors that underlie the current
statuses of women and men from all parts of the world and explores the various means
by which people have sought to achieve equality.
The program’s dual emphases on interdisciplinarity and intersectionality offer
students analytical frameworks and methodological tools with which to understand
people’s life experiences, human interactions, and economic and social institutions. By
promoting awareness and knowledge of status-based oppression; of people’s inter-
relationships; and of the ways in which civil rights movements throughout history have
struggled for equity, the program seeks to contribute to changing attitudes and practices
that tend to silence people’s voices or that work to devalue, marginalize, or subordinate
women and men’s choices and life experiences. The B.A. degree is offered in this area.
The women’s and gender studies program also offers a combined Bachelor of
Art/Master of Art degree with a 4+1 program of study. Only students who plan to
major in the women’s and gender studies program will be admitted into the combined
B.A./M.A, program. In addition to the established hours required for the undergraduate
major, students will be expected to complete a minimum of 30 hours of graduate course
work for an M.A. degree. For more information, see the <i>Graduate Bulletin</i>.

<i>
<b>Major Requirements (30 Hours) </b>
</i>

The women’s and gender studies major requires a minimum of 30 hours of course
work, 6 hours in the women’s and gender studies core and 24 hours in women’s and
gender studies electives. Courses from at least three disciplines must be included in the
elective credits, and eighteen hours must be six courses at or above the 3000 level.
Special topics courses and other variable content courses may be counted toward
elective course requirements with the approval of the women’s and gender studies
governing board. The capstone to the major is the senior project (a College
requirement).

<i>
<b>Minor in Women’s and Gender Studies (12 Hours) </b>
</i>

The women’s and gender studies minor requires a minimum of 12 hours of course
work. Students must complete WS 2013, WS 3113, and 6 hours in women’s and gender
studies electives. Courses from two disciplines must be included in the elective credits,
and three hours must be at or above the 3000 level. Special topics courses and other
variable content courses may be counted toward elective course requirements with the
approval of the women’s and gender studies governing board.

<b>Certificate in Creative Writing </b>


<b>Director </b>

Michael Wright, Creative Writing, Theatre and Film
The certificate in creative writing provides an academic study of the art and craft of
expression in poetry, fiction, nonfiction and/or performance writing, as preparation for
either graduate school or career.
The creative writing certificate is interdisciplinary in that it emphasizes the importance
of both formal and cultural diversity towards the development of the individual's vision
and voice. Students will explore the art of writing in myriad genres and styles; they also
study the applications (and implications) of creative writing through exposure to
historical, cultural, and inter-media possibilities. It is imperative for the student of any
art form to explore variations on creativity in other disciplines. Therefore the program
intersects offerings in five departments within the Henry Kendall College of Arts and
Sciences: communication, English, film studies, languages, and theatre. Occasional
offerings from other disciplines/departments may be considered for credit on a case-by-
case basis in consultation with the director of the creative writing program.

<i>
<b>Certificate Requirements (21 hours) </b>
</i>

Students must complete 21 hours of approved course work. Reading courses (6 hours)
are required from two separate disciplines. One must be a 3000- or 4000-level class. In
addition, all students pursuing the certificate must take ENGL 2403. Reading courses
may be selected from offerings listed below.
Students may focus in one form (a maximum of three courses) and must take one
course in another form in addition to their area of focus (i.e., three poetry and one
screenwriting). Prospective students must consult with the director of the creative
writing program to develop a course sequence that will work best with their major and
other requirements.

<i>
<b>Minor in Creative Writing (12 hours)  </b>
</i>

The minor consists of 12 hours of creative writing courses. Students who minor in
creative writing must take ENGL 2403. Six of the hours must be at the 3000 or 4000
levels. Courses must be selected from the list of creative writing courses below. Courses
which focus on reading only do not count toward the minor.  Specific courses will vary
from year to year and offerings may be added. Prospective students must consult with
the director of the creative writing program to develop a course sequence that will work
best with their major and other requirements.<b/>

The Collins College of Business invites graduating high school seniors with exceptional
academic records and a spirit of intellectual curiosity to consider the University’s
Honors Program. The core courses in the Honors Program, listed on page 84, are
credited to the student’s general curriculum requirement. Research is an option, but not
a requirement, for Honors students. A student’s directed research is applied either as
elective or as major required hours. Students admitted to the Honors Program receive
an academic scholarship and may choose to major in any academic discipline offered by
The University of Tulsa. More information about the Honors Program may be found
on page 20 of this <i>Bulletin</i> or at <i>www.utulsa.edu/academics/Honors-Program.aspx.</i>


<i>
<b>Internship Program </b>
</i>

Student internships are working programs jointly planned and administered by faculty
of the Collins College of Business and participating public or private organizations.
Internships provide the opportunity to reinforce knowledge of principles and concepts
introduced in the classroom through application in actual professional situations. The
program includes working arrangements with Tulsa-area organizations as well as
internship opportunities in international locations.
For the best internship opportunities and information concerning career
development, students should consult the Business Career Center during their freshman
year and their faculty advisors at the start of their junior year. Career Services will also
assist with opportunities for internships.

<i>
<b>Williams Student Services Center and Business Career Center </b>
</i>

The Williams Student Services Center opened in Helmerich Hall in August 2008 to
better serve the students in the Collins College of Business. Academic advisors for
undergraduate and graduate students work alongside the Assistant Dean for Business
Career Services to provide academic and career advising to our students. The mission of
the Williams Student Services Center is to guide men and women of diverse
backgrounds and cultures on their educational journeys by providing academic
recruiting, academic and career advising, and professional skill development to help
them prepare for leadership in 21st Century global organizations.
The Business Career Center is located inside the Williams Student Services Center.
The Center is equipped to provide many resources for undergraduate and graduate
business students, including resume review, cover letter review, job search strategies,
interview strategies, internship information, listings of available positions, and employer
information. Workshops and networking events are also provided throughout the
academic year to meet the needs of students as they pursue careers in the business
world.

<i>
<b>Applied Option  </b>
</i>

A student who selects the “Applied Option” in the Bachelor of Science in Business
Administration program or the Bachelor of Science in International Business and
Language program will apply business principles in an actual business environment
through a formal Collins College of Business internship. In addition to completing all
the requirements for the B.S.B.A. or B.S.I.B.L. degree, the student must satisfactorily
complete an additional one-semester or summer term internship course (BUS 4001,


Business Applications). The internship will be secured by the student, but must be
approved by the faculty member guiding the internship and by the associate dean.

<i>
<b>Pre-Law Study  </b>

The official statement of the American Association of Law Schools emphasizes the
preference of law schools for students who are well-rounded in their educational
backgrounds, capable of critical and creative thinking, and able to express themselves
clearly. No specific undergraduate major is required or recommended.

<b>Policies </b>


<i>
<b>Transfers </b>
</i>

Transfer policies for the Collins College of Business for the B.S.B.A. and B.S.I.B.L. are
as follows:
•  At least 50% of the business credit hours (other than economics) required for the
business degree must be completed at The University of Tulsa.
•  Credits earned at an AACSB-accredited program, while a student is not enrolled at
The University of Tulsa for one or more non-summer semesters, may be
transferred provided the credits are consistent with other transfer policies of the
College and University.
•  No transfer credit will be accepted toward the business core or major required
courses subsequent to enrollment at The University of Tulsa, with the following
exception: a maximum of six hours taken during a summer term may be transferred
from an AACSB-accredited program.
•  Acceptance of prior coursework: course content varies over time and among
institutions. Students who are transferring from other schools or who have had a
break in their degree program at The University of Tulsa must have their
transcripts reviewed by the Collins College of Business to determine which prior
courses fulfill requirements toward a degree in the College.
•  Final/official transfer evaluations will be based on specific program requirements
current at the time of a student’s first enrollment and will not necessarily apply to
another curriculum if the student changes majors.
•  After completing a total of 60 hours of college work, the Collins College of
Business will not accept transfer credit from community colleges or other two-year
colleges.

<i>
<b>Academics </b>
</i>

Academic policies for the Collins College of Business for the B.S.B.A. and B.S.I.B.L. are
as follows:
•  Electives: Students in the Collins College of Business may apply up to 18 semester
hours of Pass/D-F coursework in general education electives or free electives
toward a degree. Transfer hours, BUS 1001, and major discipline internships are
not considered part of the 18 semester hours. No more than four semester hours
of Pass/D-F coursework may be taken in one semester. A maximum of three
semester hours of activity courses (ATRG 1991 and MUS 0XXX) may be used as a
low-level free elective in the Collins College of Business. Credit by examination,
including Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and proficiency

examinations consistent with University policy, will be acceptable toward the
degree, except for business core courses (other than economics). CLEP credits are
not accepted.
•  No student in the Collins College of Business may attempt any course in which a
grade of F has been received in any two previous attempts, unless permission is
obtained. Students who have failed a course may not subsequently take a
proficiency exam as a replacement. Students who have attempted a course at The
University of Tulsa may not receive credit for that course from another university.
•  Readmittance to the Collins College of Business degree programs: Students who
expect to break their progress in a Collins College of Business degree program for
up to one year may apply for a leave of absence, ensuring their right to remain in
the degree program of their current enrollment. Students who do not complete any
courses at The University of Tulsa for more than one calendar year must reapply
for admission to the Collins College of Business and, if readmitted, will be under
the degree program in effect at the time of their readmission.
•  A maximum of 30 hours of course credits in one discipline may be applied toward
B.S.B.A. degree requirements. All B.S.B.A. and B.S.I.B.L. students must complete
48 hours of credit from 3000- and 4000-level courses in order to qualify for
graduation.
•  Business students enrolled in junior- and senior-level (3000- and 4000-level)
business and major required courses are expected to have achieved junior standing
and must have completed the following business core classes: ENGL 1033; ACCT
2113 and 2123; ECON 2013 and 2023; MATH 1093 and 1103; BUS 1001 and
2001; BL 2013; MIS 1001 and 2003; and QM 2013 and 2023 with grades of C or

must be completed outside the Collins College of Business. Up to six hours of
statistics and nine hours of economics may be included in the hours outside of
business to meet the 50% requirement.
•  Failure to successfully complete one or more of the core business courses in
sequence may necessitate summer enrollment in order to progress full-time on a
four-year graduation pace.
•  Students wishing to enroll in courses that have prerequisites must satisfactorily
complete those prerequisites before enrolling in the more advanced class, unless
granted written permission by the Undergraduate Programs staff prior to that
enrollment.
•  Non-business students pursuing a marketing minor, arts management major, or
organizational studies major must have junior standing and complete the following
prerequisites with a grade of C or higher before enrolling in MKTG 3003: ACCT

<i>
<b>Probation </b>
</i>

Students on probation in the Collins College of Business must follow all University
regulations concerning probation. In addition, College probation policies for the
B.S.B.A. and B.S.I.B.L. are as follows:
•  Students will be limited to a maximum of 13 semester hours during a fall or spring
semester and six hours during the entire summer session.


•  Students must follow other guidelines required by the dean.
•  Freshmen and sophomores on probation, and all students with a grade point
average lower than 2.0 at the end of their sophomore year, must repeat certain
courses for which a D grade is recorded during their next academic term in
residence, provided the courses are in the official schedule of courses for that term.
Courses to be repeated are specified by the student’s advisor. This will usually
include business core classes normally taken during the freshman and sophomore
year.
•  A grade of F in any business core class requires repetition at the next opportunity
while the student is in residence. The advisor may require repetition of any core
course that is a prerequisite to the courses failed.


Business professionals need a broad theoretical and practical education that prepares
them for continuous learning and effective leadership. The business curriculum
combines a broad general education and a strong business foundation with major
required courses in a specific business discipline. Courses in the social and natural
sciences, the humanities, and mathematics, as well as business, are emphasized during
the first two years of study, which are devoted to the Tulsa curriculum and introductory
business core courses. Work in the business core continues during the junior year, while
the senior year provides an opportunity to concentrate in a particular business
discipline.

The athletic training program is an undergraduate program accredited by the
Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). It is designed
to provide structured didactic and clinical experiences to prepare students for a career in
athletic training. Students are encouraged to become members of the National Athletic
Trainers’ Association.
Outcomes for the athletic training program are:
•  Demonstrate proficiency in the domains of athletic training as established by the
National Athletic Trainers’ Association, and
•  Demonstrate the ability to utilize evidence based practice research to analyze a
given situation and provide the appropriate response in clinical practice.
Students desiring to enter this program must complete the athletic training application
process, which includes submitting an application and letters of recommendation. After
submission of the application materials and admission to the University, the prospective
student will receive information about the health and safety requirements of the
program, which must be completed as outlined below. During the fall semester, the
prospective athletic training student will complete prerequisite courses, acquire a
minimum of 80 hours of observation experience in scheduled rotations, and sit for an
interview with the athletic training faculty and staff. Formal acceptance into the athletic
training program may be granted upon successful completion of prerequisite
coursework, observation hours, the interview, and other university and CAATE
standards. Due to the program’s clinical requirement, only a limited number of students
are accepted each year.

<b>Undergraduate Healthcare Programs </b>


<b>Bachelor of Science in Athletic Training </b>



Upon acceptance to the program, the student will progress through the sequence of
didactic, practicum, and clinical experience courses. Athletic training students who earn
less than a B in any athletic training didactic or practicum course or less than a C in any
foundation or clinical experience course must repeat that course. Athletic training
students must maintain an overall grade point average of at least 2.8 on the 4.0 scale.
Any student who falls below this standard or is not making progress in the athletic
training courses will be placed on probation for the following semester. The student will
be notified of their probation status in a letter from the program director. The letter will
also explain the progress that must be made during the subsequent semester in order to
be removed from probation. The student will be dismissed from the program if
adequate progress is not made. Petition for readmission must be made to the program
director. The Athletic Training Council will make readmission decisions following a
formal petition by the student.
As a part of each practicum course, the student will become proficient in the required
psychomotor skills. A significant amount of time will be required for the clinical
rotations that are part of each clinical experience class; students will be directly
supervised by Board of Certification, Inc., certified and Oklahoma licensed athletic
trainers. During the clinical experience rotations, students will complete clinical
proficiencies, learning-over-time evaluations, and other assignments that assess learning.
All students in the athletic training program must adhere to the following health and
safety requirements:

<b>Criminal Background Check:</b> Students are required to submit to a criminal
background check upon formal admission to the program as required by the contract
with off-campus clinical agencies. This will allow proper placement of students for off-
campus rotations.

<b>Liability Insurance:</b> Liability insurance is required for all students who have been
formally accepted into the athletic training program. Insurance fees are listed under
Health sciences program fees on page 33 of this <i>Bulletin</i> and are automatically billed to
the student’s account through the Bursar’s Office.

<b>Health Requirements:</b> Prior to beginning observation experiences and yearly
thereafter, students must complete online training in blood-borne pathogens, HIPAA,
the Right to Know (OSHA communication standard), and TB prevention. During the
prospective semester, students are required to present proof of the following
immunizations and screenings to the School of Nursing: TB test (using CDC guidelines
for two step method or chest X-ray), measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), diphtheria,
tetanus, pertussis (TdaP), hepatitis B, varicella and flu. These may be done at the
Alexander Health Center on campus for a fee or at a private physician’s office. Students
who do not desire the required rubella or hepatitis B immunization must sign a waiver.

<b>Transportation and Uniforms:</b> Students are responsible for providing their own
transportation to off-campus clinical sites and are required to buy their own uniforms in
accordance with the program dress code. Some uniforms may be provided by the
Department of Athletics. See the <i>Athletic Training Student Handbook</i> for dress code.

<b>Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR):</b> Students must provide documentation of
American Heart Association Basic Life Support for Healthcare Providers certification
after completing ATRG 2553 and must maintain continuous certification throughout
the remainder of the program.

<b>Physical Exam:</b> Students must submit documentation of a recent physical
examination by a physician of the student’s choice. This must be completed prior to

beginning observation experiences during the prospective semester.

<b>Written Technical Standards:</b> The written technical standards verify that the
student is capable of meeting minimum standards relating to physical, mental, and
emotional health with or without accommodations. A physician of the student’s choice
must sign this form. This form must be completed prior to beginning observation
experiences during the prospective semester.

<b>Apprentice Licensure Status:</b> Students are required to obtain apprentice athletic
trainer status through the Oklahoma Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision upon
formal admission to the program.
Completion of the degree requirements in the athletic training program at The
University of Tulsa entitles the recipient to apply to sit for the national athletic training
certification examination through the Board of Certification, Inc. (BOC). Although the
degree recipient is qualified to sit for the examination, permission to sit for the exam is
controlled by BOC and the decision is completely within the agency’s jurisdiction.

Exercise and sports science practitioners provide health care, technique/skill
instruction, and performance enhancement for the physically active population.
Foundational knowledge for this practice is gained through study of how physical
activity influences the human body. Clinical skill acquisition is also a very necessary
component. Courses within this degree program address both areas.
Outcomes for the exercise and sports science program are:
•  Demonstrate comprehension and functional knowledge of the sciences applied
to human performance and exercise,
•  Retrieve, manage, and critically analyze data relevant to the improvement of
health and human performance, and
•  Participate as professionally prepared and responsible members of their chosen
profession and community.
Exercise and sports science graduates will be prepared to seek several entry-level
certifications from agencies such as the American College of Sports Medicine and the
National Strength and Conditioning Association. This degree also prepares students for
graduate studies in any one of a number of sports medicine-related fields of study.
Students pursuing entrance into professional allied health care programs must be
advised that the specific school or program might dictate additional course
requirements. These students are advised to obtain the most current admission
requirements from that school and work with their advisor in assuring all requirements
are met.
Students pursuing this degree must earn a grade of C or higher in all courses with the
ATRG prefix, as well as BIOL 2153, 2151, 2173, and 2171. Internship experiences have
prerequisite courses and enrollment requires the permission of the advisor. Any student
who receives a failing grade in an internship course is subject to immediate dismissal
from the program. Internships may not be taken simultaneously. Students pursuing
teacher certification must meet the School of Urban Education criteria for admission
into teacher education and student teaching described on page 128 of this <i>Bulletin</i>.

The School of Nursing’s undergraduate curriculum leads to the Bachelor of Science
degree in Nursing (B.S.N.). The curriculum provides a broad general education and a
solid professional program based on a nursing model (the Roy Adaptation Model) rich
in content and applicability. Our goal is to produce an educated individual who is a
professional nurse.

<i>
<b>Nursing Major Learning Objectives </b>
</i>

•  To value the dignity and worth of humans by practicing legally and ethically in all
aspects of nursing.
•  To empower individuals, families, and communities by promoting the welfare of
local, state, and national health through nursing activities.
•  To utilize critical thinking, independent judgment, leadership skills, and
communication skills to promote achievement of optimal health.
•  To apply theoretical and empirical knowledge from the humanities, physical, and
behavioral sciences while committing to lifelong learning and ongoing professional
development.



<i>
<b/>
</i>


<b>Bachelor of Science in Nursing </b>



<i>
<b>Accreditation </b>
</i>

The nursing program is approved by the Oklahoma Board of Nursing. The
baccalaureate nursing program is accredited by the Accreditation Commission for
Education in Nursing, 3343 Peachtree Road NE, Suite 850, Atlanta, GA 30326. The
School of Nursing is a member of the National League for Nursing and the American
Association of Colleges of Nursing.

<i>
<b>Applicants for Licensure </b>
</i>

Graduates of this state-approved program are eligible to apply to write the National
Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) for registered nurses. Applicants for
Oklahoma licensure must meet all state and federal requirements to hold an Oklahoma
license to practice nursing. In addition to completing a state-approved nursing
education program that meets educational requirements and successfully passing the
licensure examination, requirements include submission of an application for licensure,
a criminal history records search, and evidence of citizenship or qualified alien status.
Applicants for practical nurse licensure must also hold a high school diploma or a
graduate equivalency degree (G.E.D.) [59 O.S. §567.5 &amp; 567.6]. To be granted a license,
an applicant must have the legal right to be in the United States (United States Code
Chapter 8, Section 1621). In addition, Oklahoma law only allows a license to be issued
to U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, and legal permanent resident aliens. Other qualified
aliens may be issued a temporary license that is valid until the expiration of their visa
status, or if there is no expiration date, for one year. Applicants who are qualified aliens
must present to the Board office, in person, valid documentary evidence of:
1.  A valid, unexpired immigrant or nonimmigrant visa status for admission into the
United States;
2.  A pending or approved application for asylum in the United States;
3.  Admission into the United States in refugee status;
4.  A pending or approved application for temporary protected status in the United
States;
5.  Approved deferred action status; or
6.  A pending application for adjustment of status to legal permanent resident status
or conditional resident status.
The Board has the right to deny a license to an individual with a history of criminal
background, disciplinary action on any professional or occupational license or
certification, or judicial declaration of mental incompetence [59 O.S. §567.8]. These
cases are considered on an individual basis at the time application for licensure is made,
with the exception of felony convictions. An individual with a felony conviction cannot
apply for licensure for at least five years after completion of all sentencing terms,
including probation and suspended sentences, unless a presidential or gubernatorial
pardon is received [59 O.S. §567.5 &amp; 567.6].

<i>
<b>Admission and Progression  </b>
</i>

Once admitted to the University, students apply to the School of Nursing for admission
to the nursing program. As clinical spaces are limited, a competitive selection process
occurs during the spring semester for students who wish to enroll in fall sophomore-
level nursing courses. International students interested in the B.S.N. must have a


TOEFL score of 80 on the computer-based exam. Foreign college credit requires a
“Full Education Course-by-Course Report” by the Commission on Graduates of
Foreign Nursing Schools prior to admission to the School of Nursing. Advanced
standing may be obtained with approval of courses on college transcripts. Transfer
students will not be permitted to pursue a nursing major at TU if they have been
previously enrolled in a nursing program and were not in good standing in that nursing
program upon exit. Exceptions may be granted, for good reason as determined by the
director, based on individual situations if as part of their application a letter from the
dean or director of the nursing program indicates eligibility for re-admission to the prior
program.

<i>
<b>Performance Standards for Admission and Progression in the Bachelor </b>
</i>


<i>
<b>of Science in Nursing  </b>
</i>

The University of Tulsa is committed to compliance with Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990.
Therefore, the School of Nursing at The University of Tulsa seeks to ensure that
qualified persons with disabilities are not denied admission or subject to discrimination
in admissions.
The Performance Standards for Admission and Progression in the Bachelor of
Science in Nursing establish the expectations and requisite abilities considered essential
for students admitted to the clinical component of the nursing program in order to
achieve the level of competency required for graduation and practice. These include
abilities in eight categories: critical thinking, interpersonal, communication, mobility,
motor skills, hearing, visual, and tactile.
It is recognized that degrees of ability vary widely among individuals. Any candidate
who feels that he or she may not meet the Performance Standards for Admission and
Progression in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing as set forth in this <i>Bulletin</i> is
encouraged to contact the director of the School of Nursing. Any candidate who may
require academic accommodations to fulfill the technical standards due to a disability is
encouraged to contact the Center for Student Academic Support at 918-631-2315. The
University of Tulsa is committed to enabling its students, by any reasonable means or
accommodations, to complete the course of study leading to the Bachelor of Science in
Nursing.
All students are assigned a faculty advisor to assist them in their advancement
through the program. Students must earn a grade of C or higher in all nursing
foundation courses before entering courses for which the nursing foundation course is a
prerequisite. The student must have a University of Tulsa cumulative grade point
average of at least 2.5 before entering the Level I sophomore year nursing course and in
order to progress to Level II junior and Level III senior nursing major courses. A
student who receives a grade below C in any nursing major or nursing foundation
course is dismissed from the program, but may reapply for admission to the program. If
a student leaves the nursing program for more than six semesters (excluding summers),
the student must retake all nursing courses beginning with the second semester
sophomore courses, if readmitted.

<i>
<b>Nursing Scholarships  </b>
</i>

Grants, loans, and work-study opportunities are available through the University’s
Office of Student Financial Services. Scholarship funds, such as the Nettie M. Jones

Foundation scholarships, have been established for the School of Nursing. To apply for
a nursing scholarship, a student must be admitted to The University of Tulsa, complete
the FAFSA financial aid form, and have the results sent to the University each spring
semester.
Additional funds may be awarded directly to the student for junior and senior years
by Tulsa-area hospitals. Students repay these additional funds by working for the
funding institution after graduation. Out-of-town students who plan to return home
after graduation should check with their local hospitals for similar financial assistance.

<i>
<b>Advanced Standing Program for Registered Nurses  </b>
</i>

The School of Nursing has adopted the Oklahoma Nursing Articulation Model for
Registered Nurses. Progression is based on experience, and/or refresher course, or
equivalent, and accreditation of the basic nursing program. The procedure for The
University of Tulsa School of Nursing is to verify the following:
1.  Current Oklahoma licensure,
2.  Transcripts,
3.  Basic nursing program accreditation, and
4.  Recent employment (up to 5 years previous) or refresher course completion.
The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.) degree requires 125 credit hours for
graduation. A maximum of 37 credit hours may be earned by proficiency examinations,
transcript evaluation, clinical experience, and licensure. A maximum of 60 credits for
equivalent courses may be transferred from a two-year community/junior college.
Credit may be earned by transfer credit and proficiency exam for the following lower
division nursing courses: AHS 2122; NSG 2233, 2254, 2264, and 2273. Credit will be
awarded for NSG 3154, 3164, 3174, 3254, 3264, and 3274 (24 credit hours) after
successful completion of nursing senior courses or proficiency examination. For further
information, consult the director of the School of Nursing.

<i>
<b>Upward Mobility Program for Licensed Practical Nurses  </b>
</i>

Licensed Practical Nurses may earn up to 13 credit hours through proficiency
examinations for NSG 2254, 2264, 2273 and AHS 2122. L.P.N. students are required to
take NSG 2023 in addition to the standard B.S.N. requirements. For further
information, consult the director of the School of Nursing.

<i>
<b>Other Information and Requirements  </b>
</i>

Nursing students must also meet the following requirements:

<b>Criminal Background Check and Drug Testing:</b> Nursing students are required
for specific clinical placement to have a criminal background check conducted. This
check is required at the time of admission to the nursing program and as specified by
clinical agencies. All nursing students must also have required drug testing to progress in
nursing courses.

<b>Liability Insurance:</b> Liability insurance is required for any student enrolled in
nursing clinical courses. Insurance fees are listed under Health sciences program fees on
page 33 of this <i>Bulletin</i> and are automatically billed to the student’s account through the
Bursar’s Office.

<b>Health Requirements:</b> Prior to beginning clinical observations and yearly thereafter,
students must complete training in blood-borne pathogens, HIPAA, the Right to Know


(OSHA communication standard), fire safety, and TB prevention. Students are required
to present proof of the following immunizations and screenings to the School of
Nursing: TB test using CDC guidelines for two step method or chest X- ray, measles,
mumps, rubella (MMR), tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (TdaP), hepatitis B, varicella, and
flu. These may be done at the Alexander Health Center on campus for a fee or at a
private physician’s office. Students who do not desire the required rubella or hepatitis B
immunization must sign a waiver. Students must also have their healthcare provider
complete the “Performance Standards” document confirming the students’ abilities in
eight categories.

<b>Transportation and Uniforms:</b> Students are responsible for providing their own
transportation to clinical areas and are required to buy their own uniforms, in
accordance with the program dress code. See the <i>Nursing Student Handbook</i> for dress
code.

<b>Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR):</b> Prior to sophomore admission and every
year thereafter, nursing students must provide documentation of American Heart
Association Basic Life Support for Healthcare Provider certification.

<b>Equipment:</b> For nursing clinical courses, students are required to purchase a mobile
handheld device and clinical software. Additional equipment for clinical courses must be
purchased in the sophomore and junior years.

<b>Clinical Hub Fee:</b> The clinical hub is a system developed for schools to schedule
clinical experiences and for clinical agencies to obtain information about students using
their agencies. Students must pay an annual fee directly through the clinical hub.

<i>
<b>Licensure  </b>
</i>

The University of Tulsa cannot guarantee that completion of the baccalaureate program
of nursing will enable a graduate to take the National Council of State Boards of
Nursing Licensure Examination.

<b>Honors Program  </b>
</i>

Freshmen entering the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences with exceptional
records will be considered for the University’s Honors Program. More information
about the Honors Program may be found on pages 20 and 84 of this <i>Bulletin</i> or at

<i>www.utulsa.edu/academics/Honors-Program.aspx</i>

.


<i>
<b>Tau Beta Pi  </b>
</i>

Students in engineering or the physical sciences and other closely related fields who are
in the upper eighth of the junior class or the upper fifth of the senior class are eligible
for membership in Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honor society. Candidates must
also exhibit personal integrity, a range of interests within and outside of the field of
engineering, and an ability to adapt to a wide range of professional situations.

<b>Academic Programs  </b>


<i>
<b>Advanced Standing  </b>
</i>

All previous education presented to the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences for
advanced standing must conform to applicable University requirements and is subject to
the following special requirements:
  No more than 36 hours of advanced standing credit may apply through testing
(International Baccalaureate, OSSM, Advanced Placement or proficiency exam).
  Course credits with grades of D normally do not transfer from other schools.
  Upper-level engineering courses normally do not transfer from schools that are not
accredited by ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology).
  The last 45 semester hours in a degree program must be completed in residence.
  Final/official transfer evaluations will be based on specific balance sheets current at
the time of a student’s first enrollment and will not necessarily apply to another
curriculum if the student changes majors.
  International students and others who apply for advanced standing credit for
studies completed at foreign institutions must present certified English translations
of transcripts or their equivalents from all foreign institutions attended.
Documents and transcripts from foreign institutions are subject to individual review
and interpretation. It is not unusual to require international students to validate course
work of unknown quality by examination and to repeat courses in areas where
knowledge appears inadequate. Credit for work completed at a foreign institution is
always subject to review and reassessment because of differences in accrediting
practices, grading methods and customs, and course content. Such credit is normally
recorded as total hours of advanced standing for a specific curriculum and will not
necessarily apply to another curriculum.
Advanced standing may be granted for junior college for work up to one-half the
hours required for graduation from the University. Such credit should be obtained
before admission. Additional junior college work will be credited toward a degree from
the University only by permission before enrollment in courses.
Permission to transfer additional junior college hours will be granted only if there are
extenuating circumstances that prevent the student from taking a similar course at The
University of Tulsa. Students who want permission to transfer additional junior college
hours should submit a written request to the associate dean for academic affairs before
enrolling at a junior college. The extenuating circumstances that make the transfer of
the additional hours necessary should be spelled out clearly in the written request.
Tuition differentials, personal finances, or the fact that a course may be easier at a junior
college do not qualify as extenuating circumstances.



<i>
<b>Special Requirements  </b>
</i>

In all programs in the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences, students must
maintain an overall minimum grade point average of 2.0 as well as a 2.0 or better in their
major courses, as defined by the individual department. In addition to these
requirements, many programs also require minimum grade point average and
completion time limits after admission on specified foundation courses.
Students wishing to change majors must satisfy the foundation course requirements
(if any) of their new major and receive permission of the department chair in their new
major.
The table below indicates special minimum grade point requirements for each degree
program. The designated foundation courses for a particular program are detailed in the
sections containing degree requirements.

No student in the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences may attempt any
course in which a grade of F has been received in any two previous attempts, unless
permission is obtained.
Students typically complete Exposition and Argumentation (ENGL 1033) during
their first semester in residence, followed by Writing for the Professions (ENGL 3003)
in the junior year. However, some incoming students will be placed in ENGL 1004,
Introduction to College Writing, in order to provide them with additional skills
necessary for college-level writing. These students will complete ENGL 1004 and
ENGL 1033 in their first two semesters in residence, followed by ENGL 3003 in the
junior year.
Students wishing to enroll in courses that have prerequisites must satisfactorily
complete those prerequisites before enrolling in the more advanced class, unless granted
written permission by the instructor and their faculty advisor prior to that enrollment.

Students who have failed a course may not subsequently take a proficiency exam as
replacement for that course.
Students who have attempted a course at The University of Tulsa may not receive
credit for that course from another institution.

<i>
<b>Pass/D-F Grading  </b>
</i>

The decision to take a course on a Pass/D-F basis must be made within the first three
weeks of a regular semester or by the published deadlines for each summer session.
Changing from a letter grade to the Pass/D-F option or back to a letter grade must be
completed during this period. The student must obtain approval to take a course
Pass/D-F from the College Office of Advising. Deadlines for declaring this option are
not subject to change.
Students enrolled in the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences may complete
up to 18 semester hours of coursework offered by other colleges on a Pass/D-F basis,
but no more than 4 hours in any given semester. Engineering and science majors may
not take courses offered by the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences Pass/D-F.
Engineering and science majors may not take ENGL 1004, 1033, or 3003 Pass/D-F.
Engineering and science majors may not take any courses designated HON or GLSC on
a Pass/D-F basis. A course in the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences which is
graded only on a Pass/D-F basis (such as an introduction to the major) is not
considered part of the 18-hour total. A student on a semester Study Abroad may be
allowed to take more than one course Pass/D-F, subject to approvals by the Center for
Global Education and the College. A course previously taken for a letter grade may not
be repeated on a Pass/D-F basis.

<i>
<b>Probation  </b>
</i>

In addition to the University’s probation regulations, the College of Engineering and
Natural Sciences has the following specific requirements:
  The maximum load for a student on probation is 14 semester hours during a
semester and seven hours during any summer session.
  Freshmen and sophomores on probation, and all students a grade point averages
lower than 2.0 at the end of their sophomore years, must repeat certain courses for
which a D grade is recorded during their next academic term in residence, provided
the courses are in the official schedule of courses for that term. Courses to be
repeated are specified by the student’s advisor.
  A grade of F in any required mathematics, science, or professional engineering
course requires repetition at the next opportunity while the student is in residence.
The advisor may require repetition of any course prerequisite to the courses failed.

<i>
<b>Electives  </b>
</i>

Students in the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences must fulfill all relevant
requirements of the Tulsa curriculum described on page 18 of this <i>Bulletin</i>. In addition,
many curricula contain a number of elective courses. The following specific
requirements apply to electives and the Tulsa curriculum:
  Students may choose to take two semesters of a single foreign language and apply
them as Block I and Block II credits.


  Most courses at The University of Tulsa may be taken for general elective credit,
with the following exceptions: all sections of ATRG 1991 and MUS 0021 in fall
semesters. In addition, no more than three one-credit-hour music courses may
apply toward a degree.

<i>
<b>Double Majors/Double Degrees  </b>
</i>

Students who wish to pursue majors or degrees in two different fields may do so by
completing the requirements for each major. Double majors or double degrees can be
pursued either in one college or in two different colleges. In the latter case, permission
from the deans of both colleges must be obtained at the time the second major/degree
is declared.

<i>
<b>5000 Level Courses  </b>
</i>

Certain departments have course offerings at the 5000 level, which are graduate courses
available to exceptional students for undergraduate degree credit. See individual
departments for availability and procedures governing enrollment.

optometry, physical therapy, or other professional fields should obtain a pre-
professional advisor within the Department of Biological Science as early in their college
careers as possible.

<i>
<b>Nursing and Allied Health Majors </b>
</i>

Nursing, exercise and sports science, and athletic training students in consultation with a
nursing advisor should enroll in the sequence BIOL 2151, 2153, 2171, and 2173.

<i>
<b>Minor Fields for Biology Majors  </b>
</i>

Biology majors may minor in any subject. However, a minor in physical sciences
(including inorganic/organic chemistry and physics) is strongly recommended since
many biology elective courses presume an understanding of basic organic chemistry and
most professional and graduate schools require 16 hours of chemistry, 8 hours of
physics, and mathematics through calculus.

<i>
<b>Teacher Certification </b>
</i>

Students seeking secondary teacher certification in biology must also complete
requirements for a second major in education described under the School of Urban
Education beginning on page 128 of this <i>Bulletin</i>. In addition, teacher certification
requires proficiency in a second language at the novice level (see page 131).

The mission of the Department of Chemical Engineering is to provide a modern, high-
quality educational experience for all students in order to graduate chemical engineers
who are technically competent, creative, literate, and socially aware. The B.S. degree
program in chemical engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation
Commission of ABET,

<i>http://www.abet.org</i>

. Our educational objectives are to provide a
foundation for successful chemical engineering careers in the petroleum, natural gas,
chemicals, alternative energy, environmental, materials, or biotechnology industries, and
for graduate studies in chemical engineering or related fields such as medicine, law, and
business administration.
The Department of Chemical Engineering offers a curriculum leading to the
traditional Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering (B.S.Ch.E.) degree. A 4/1
program leading to both a B.S.Ch.E. degree and Master of Engineering in Chemical
Engineering (M.Ch.E.) degree in five years from the high school diploma is also
available for highly qualified students. A co-op program, where students work in an
approved industrial employment setting for up to three semesters during their B.S.
degree, is optional. Students are responsible for finding employers for the co-op
program and obtaining approval.
Students, in conjunction with their advisors, may choose elective courses that form a
cohesive area of specialization within chemical engineering. Current options include
petroleum refining, materials, pre-med, business, and environmental engineering.
Qualified students may also pursue undergraduate research culminating in a senior
research project. Students who have been admitted to the University’s Honors Program
may also participate in undergraduate research in chemical engineering. Exceptionally
well-qualified students, with their advisor’s approval, may make additional substitutions
in the curriculum to allow further specialization in their selected areas of interest.
Students interested in the 4/1 B.S.Ch.E./M.Ch.E. program are generally admitted to the
program at the end of their junior year of study toward the B.S.Ch.E. degree. Applicants
to the 4/1 program must have completed 96 hours of coursework toward the B.S.
degree, completed CHE 3084 and all prerequisites of CHE 3084, and have a GPA of
3.5 or higher. A typical schedule for the senior and final years for a student in the 4/1
program may be obtained at

<i>www.che.utulsa.edu</i>

by following the link to “Graduate
Program” or by consulting The University of Tulsa <i>Graduate Bulletin</i>.

All of the curricula in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry emphasize
laboratory experience and culminate in a senior research project. This active
involvement in the field provides experiences and a learning environment designed to
stress both the conceptual basis and the experimental nature of the discipline.
The Department offers three options for students interested in the fields of chemistry
or biochemistry. The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree provides the opportunity to
develop a broad background in chemistry within the framework of a liberal arts
education. It is appropriate for students who wish to understand the basics but do not
anticipate a career as a research chemist. The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees consist
of courses in chemistry, physics, mathematics, writing and humanities. The curricula
provide a firm foundation for graduate or advanced professional study. Two degrees are
available: a B.S. in chemistry and a B.S. in biochemistry. With appropriate selection of
electives, both programs lead to a degree certified by the American Chemical Society.
The B.S. in chemistry can be tailored to suit interests in environmental chemistry,
advanced materials, applied chemistry, and health (pharmaceutical), as well as traditional
chemistry. The B.S. in biochemistry emphasizes chemistry and biology at the molecular
level. It is well suited to students who anticipate graduate work in the biochemical or
health sciences, or plan to pursue a professional degree program (medical or dental).
Both B.S. degrees can be part of a combined Bachelor of Science/Master of Science
(B.S./M.S.) degree program. This is a five-year program that upon completion results in
the awarding of B.S and M.S. degrees in chemistry or biochemistry. Undergraduate
students interested in this program must have at least 60 credit hours completed with a
grade point average of at least 3.4 in order to apply. Once admitted to the program,
students must take three 5000 level chemistry courses as advanced science electives
during their junior and senior years. For additional information concerning the
combined degrees see The University of Tulsa <i>Graduate Bulletin.  </i>




<b>Chemistry and Biochemistry </b>


Upon completion of the B.A. or B.S. program, students will have developed a set of
core skills which they use in approaching the fundamental concepts. These include:
  Conducting meaningful and successful experiments,
  Communicating results,
  Thinking critically,
  Acting ethically, and
  Extending results through lifelong learning.

<i>
<b>Minor in Chemistry </b>
</i>

Students from other disciplines may minor in chemistry. A minor in chemistry is
granted when the student successfully completes General Chemistry I and II with
laboratories (CHEM 1011, 1013, 1021 and 1023), Organic Chemistry I and II with
laboratories (CHEM 3011, 3013, 3021 and 3023) plus eight credit hours of additional
chemistry courses at the 2000 level or above.

<i>
<b>Teacher Certification </b>
</i>

Students seeking secondary teacher certification in chemistry must also complete
requirements for a second major in education described under the School of Urban
Education beginning on page 128 of this <i>Bulletin</i>. In addition, teacher certification
requires proficiency in a second language at the novice level (see page 131).

The Department of Geosciences offers Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Bachelor of Arts
(B.A.) degree programs in geosciences.

<i>
<b>B.S. Degree Programs  </b>
</i>

The B.S. degree programs require three semesters of mathematics in calculus and/or
statistics, one year of chemistry, and one year of calculus-based physics. In addition,
support courses in the sciences are required. Courses may not be offered every year. A
six-credit-hour course in field geology is required and must be taken at another
university. Students graduating with a B.S. degree in geosciences usually enter a
professional career in the geosciences or further their education at the graduate level
before working professionally in the geosciences.
B.S. degree options include:
  Bachelor of Science in Geosciences (B.S.G.S.)- Environmental Science Option
  Bachelor of Science in Geosciences (B.S.G.S.) - Geology Option
  Bachelor of Science in Geophysics (B.S.G.P.)
The goals of the Bachelor of Science programs in geosciences and geophysics are to
provide students with critical content knowledge, and to develop their analytical skills.
Upon completion, students in the Bachelor of Science in Geosciences - Environmental
Science Option degree program will:
  Understand Earth systems, their impact on humans and the impact that human
activity can have,
  Develop skills to critically analyze environmental topics using quantitative methods,
and
  Synthesize interdisciplinary knowledge about environmental challenges.



<b>Geosciences </b>


Upon completion, students in the Bachelor of Science in Geosciences - Geology
Option degree program will:
  Understand Earth systems and the relationship of geosciences to society,
  Learn to communicate effectively within their discipline, and
  Develop the ability to think spatially and temporally to quantitatively solve
problems.
Upon completion, students in the Bachelor of Science in Geophysics degree program
will:
  Acquire detailed content knowledge in geophysics,
  Develop quantitative problem solving skills, and

Develop critical thinking skills.

Students are encouraged to take minors in associated technical fields. Minors in
mathematics, chemistry, physics, petroleum engineering and computer sciences are
among the many minors available. Students may also minor in areas of special interest.
Students in geosciences must maintain a grade point average of at least 2.0 in
geoscience, math, chemistry and physics classes, and an overall grade point average of at
least 2.0 in order to graduate. Foundation courses in geosciences include MATH 2014,
CHEM 1013, GEOL 1014, and PHYS 2053. Refer to the table on page 360 of this

<i>Bulletin</i> for specific GPA requirements.
Students in the 4+1 B.S./M.S. program will start research in their senior year. The
suggested sequence of courses during the 5th year will be determined by the student’s
graduate advisor. Students interested in this program must have at least 60 hours
completed with a grade point average of at least 3.5 in order to apply. Students in the
4+1 degree program take 9 hours of graduate courses in their fourth year, 3 to 6 hours
of coursework during the summer, and the remaining courses during the fifth year.

<i>
<b>B.A. Degree Programs  </b>
</i>

The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree programs are broadly based, classical liberal arts
degrees that offer considerable flexibility to students interested in the earth sciences, but
who do not necessarily want to work in the petroleum industry or related industries.
The degree programs offer an excellent background in the sciences and in technology
while still preserving the flexibility and strength of a liberal arts education. The B.A.
programs offer the technical background needed to compete effectively in a changing
job market in a range of career paths. If free electives are selected carefully, this major
can provide the background necessary for entry into graduate-level studies in law,
geology, environmental science, environmental policy, meteorology, or business.
Students are encouraged to select a minor in allied fields of study to enhance their
educational experience.
B.A. degree options include:
  Bachelor of Arts with a Major in Earth and Environmental Sciences
  Bachelor of Arts with a Major in Geology
The goals of the Bachelor of Arts programs in geosciences are to provide students with
content knowledge and an understanding of interdisciplinary research and
communication.


Upon completion, students in the Bachelor of Arts with a Major in Earth and
Environmental Sciences degree program will:
  Understand interactions of Earth's four major spheres,
  Develop critical thinking and communication skills, and
  Synthesize interdisciplinary knowledge about current environmental challenges.
Upon completion, students in the Bachelor of Arts with a Major in Geology degree
program will:
  Develop an understanding of fundamental Earth processes,
  Develop the ability to synthesize and analyze original data, and

Develop an appreciation for, and involvement in internationalization initiatives.

Many geology courses require field trips, and a nominal fee over and above tuition
will be assessed to cover field trip expenses.

<i>
<b>Teacher Certification </b>
</i>

Students seeking secondary teacher certification in earth sciences must also complete
requirements for a second major in education described under the School of Urban
Education beginning on page 128 of this <i>Bulletin</i>. In addition, teacher certification
requires proficiency in a second language at the novice level (see page 131).

<i>
<b>Research </b>
</i>

Both the B.S. and the B.A. track have options for undergraduate research for students
wishing to participate in mentored research opportunities, and for geoscience
internships for students wishing to gain practical experience in the industrial
applications of the geosciences.

The Department of Mathematics offers degree programs in mathematics and applied
mathematics and provides courses in mathematics and statistics to serve the needs of all
students at the University. The mission of the Department of Mathematics is to provide
students with an understanding of mathematical knowledge, methods, and analytical
skills needed to pursue advanced degrees or careers requiring expertise in mathematics.
To that end, students will be expected to:
•  Demonstrate the ability to apply algebraic, geometric, calculus and higher-order
thinking, and statistical methods to modeling and solving real-world problems.
•  Use mathematical reasoning skills and formal logic to develop convincing
mathematical arguments.
•  Use computational tools to enhance mathematical thinking and understanding, to
solve mathematical problems, and to judge the reasonableness of the results.
Both a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in
mathematics are offered and provide the student with a sound foundation in
mathematics. The B.A. program encourages the study of languages, whereas the B.S.
program emphasizes supporting study in the physical sciences and computer science.
The Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics (B.S.A.M.) is offered with five
options: computer sciences, engineering, biomathematics, business, and education. Each
student must select one option and meet those requirements. The options provide a
field of application for the mathematics student. All options carry the same mathematics
requirement but differ in required supporting subjects. The applied mathematics
program provides a solid foundation in undergraduate mathematics in preparation for
graduate study or for a position in business or industry.

The Department of Physics and Engineering Physics offers programs leading to the
Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees in physics, and to the
Bachelor of Science in Engineering Physics (B.S.E.P.) degree. All programs provide a
critical core understanding of physics and culminate in a two-semester senior
thesis/research design project.
The B.A. degree in physics prescribes a thorough undergraduate physics curriculum
while retaining flexibility to engage in a breadth of courses in the arts and sciences.
Students are expected to show proficiency in a second language and to complete a
concentration (at least 12 credit hours) in a field outside of their major. This degree
option is particularly well suited as part of an education or pre-medical program.
The B.S. degree in physics provides a strong foundation in physics and mathematics
in preparation for a technical or scientific career. Students pursuing the B.S. degree
enroll in a more rigorous set of technical classes than for the B.A. degree. The B.S.
degree requires two advanced special topics courses in physics. These courses have been
incorporated to allow students flexibility in their junior and senior years to focus on
specific fields of physics. The B.S. degree in physics provides a broad based technical
major and is very adaptable for students in pre-professional programs (medical, law,
etc.) and for education majors.
The B.S. degree program in engineering physics is accredited by the Engineering
Accreditation Commission of ABET,

<i>http://www.abet.org</i>

.
The goal of the engineering physics program is to provide the training in physics and
engineering to prepare our students for careers in technical fields in industry, higher
education, and for lifelong learning. Consistent with this goal, the educational objectives
for the engineering physics program are to provide graduates with:
  The knowledge to successfully enter and complete programs of graduate study in
one of several engineering fields as well as in physics;
  The skills to be able to function as productive engineering professionals in areas
where traditional science and engineering disciplines overlap; and
  An awareness of the importance of continued professional self-development.



<b>Physics and Engineering Physics </b>


Both B.S. degrees can be part of a combined Bachelor of Science/Master of Science
(B.S./M.S.) degree program. These are five year programs that, upon successful
completion, results in the awarding of B.S. and M.S. degrees in physics or B.S.E.P. and
M.S. degrees in engineering physics. Undergraduate students interested in this program
must have completed at least 60 credit hours with a grade point average of at least 3.4 to
apply. A typical schedule for a student in the 4+1 program can be obtained on the
Department of Physics and Engineering Physics website, <i>www.physics.utulsa.edu</i>.

<i>
<b>Teacher Certification </b>
</i>

Students seeking secondary teacher certification in physics must also complete
requirements for a second major in education described under the School of Urban
Education beginning on page 128 of this <i>Bulletin</i>. In addition, teacher certification
requires proficiency in a second language at the novice level (see page 131).

<i>
<b>Minor in Physics  </b>
</i>

Students from all colleges may minor in physics. The requirements for the physics
minor are PHYS 2053, 2051, 2063, 2061, 2073, 2071, and 3053; and at least six hours of
physics at the 4000 level.

The University of Tulsa College of Law is ranked as a top 100 law school in the nation
by <i>U.S. News and World Report 2014 Best Graduate Schools</i> rankings. As one of the smallest
law schools in the country, the College of Law offers six degree programs: the Juris
Doctorate; an LL.M. degree in American Indian and Indigenous Law; an LL.M. degree
in American Law for Foreign Lawyers; an L.L.M. in Energy and Natural Resources Law;
an online Master of Jurisprudence in Indian Law; and an online Master of Jurisprudence
in Energy Law. In partnership with the Graduate School, the College of Law offers 10
joint J.D./master degrees, including J.D./M.A. degrees in anthropology, clinical
psychology, computer Science, English, history and industrial psychology; J.D./M.B.A;
and J.D./M.S. degrees in biological sciences, finance, and geosciences.
The College of Law’s J.D. program is comprehensive with a broad-based curriculum
but also offers specialization opportunities in sustainable energy and resource law;
Native American law; and health law. Students have opportunities to develop the
professional skills needed for transitioning into the practice of law through the Boesche
Legal Clinic’s Immigrant Rights Project and Family Advocacy Clinic, the Legal
Externship Program, the Judicial Externship Program, and the many career-building
programs offered by the Professional Development Office. The <i>Tulsa Law Review</i> and
the <i>Energy Law Journal</i> provide students with opportunities to publish articles
demonstrating their legal reasoning and writing skills.
With an enrollment of about 320 students, the College of Law offers students
opportunities for small class sizes, one-on-one interactions with professors, and
individualized career counseling. Professors and students enjoy newly-renovated
facilities that include state-of-the-art electronic classroom technology. Academic life is

<b>The College of Law </b>





enriched by the College of Law’s many lectures, conferences, and programs which are
open to the entire Tulsa community.

<b>Mabee Legal Information Center (MLIC). </b>The Mabee Legal Information Center
(MLIC) holds more than 430,000 volumes and features a solid general legal collection as
well as specialized collections in energy and environmental law and Native American
law. All MLIC users have access to a vast number of law-related electronic resources,
including LEXIS and WESTLAW. In addition, the MLIC houses two student journal
offices, the Board of Advocates, and the Public Interest Board. The Utsey Family
Native American Law Center is a beautiful and inviting reading room featuring Native
American rare and primary resources and artwork representing all the Oklahoma tribes.

<b>Boesche Legal Clinic.</b> The Boesche Legal Clinic, through the Immigrant Rights
Project and the Lobeck Taylor Family Advocacy Clinic, operates as a law firm. Students
gain experience interviewing and counseling clients, negotiating with attorneys, planning
cases, conducting factual investigations, drafting documents, examining and preparing
witnesses, working with federal, state, and local government agencies, and providing
written and oral advocacy and community education workshops.
The faculty and students of the Immigrant Rights Project represent non-citizens in
immigration matters. Clients primarily include persons seeking asylum in the United
States as a result of persecution or a fear of persecution in their home countries. The
clinic may also represent non-citizen victims of domestic violence, unaccompanied non-
citizen minors, or other non-citizens subject to removal and immigration detention.
In the Lobeck Taylor Family Advocacy Clinic, students serve the Tulsa community by
providing representation that increases access to justice for low-income individuals and
families. Clinic cases may involve legal issues related to domestic violence, housing,
public benefits, consumer debt, or collateral challenges that stem from clients’
involvement in the criminal justice system.

<b>Price and Turpen Courtroom.</b> The Price and Turpen Courtroom, designed for the
future of legal instruction, includes a state-of-the art sound system, broadcast and
recording capabilities, videoconferencing technology, and wireless network access. The
room is a working courtroom and the venue for several Oklahoma civil and criminal
cases each year.

<b>Externships.</b> The externship program offers 2L and 3L students the opportunity to
earn academic credit while gaining practical client experience in the field. Students work
in a legal setting under the direct supervision of a licensed attorney or judge while also
taking a contemporaneous academic course which provides the opportunity for
reflection and additional substantive knowledge. Externships provide students the
opportunity to move from thinking like a lawyer in the classroom to thinking like a
lawyer in a practice setting through work on real cases and legal issues. Opportunities
exist in a broad range of civil and criminal litigation as well as transactional law.
Placements include courts, law firms, government agencies, non-profit organizations
and corporate legal departments. Full semester out-of-state placements are available
during the summers and/or the last semester of the 3L year.

<b>Sustainable Energy and Resources Law (SERL) Program.</b> The SERL Program
has three principal objectives: 1) offer comprehensive training in the fields of energy,
environmental, and natural resources law; 2) produce nationally and internationally
recognized scholarship and research that contributes to the public policy debate; and 3)
facilitate communication among the many individuals, companies, organizations, and
public bodies interested in energy, environmental and natural resources, with the


expectation that such communication will lead to more enlightened national and
international laws and policies.
SERL accomplishes its objectives through an advanced curriculum; the scholarship
and public presentations of the SERL faculty and members of the SERL Board of
Visitors; publication of the<i> Energy Law Journal</i> in conjunction with the Energy Bar
Association; publication of the <i>Environment, Energy, and Resources Law: The Year in Review</i>

in conjunction with the ABA Section of Environment, Energy and Resources; and
student-centered co-curricular activities in conjunction with the student-led Resources,
Energy, and Environmental Law Society (REELS). SERL’s curricular offerings include
a Sustainable Energy and Resources Law Certificate for J.D. students, an LL.M. for
Foreign Graduates, and an online Master of Jurisprudence in Energy Law designed
primarily for non-lawyers. SERL’s co-curricular activities include opportunities to work
and network with members of its partner organizations, including the Energy Bar
Association; the ABA Section of Environment, Energy and Resources; REELS; and the
SERL Board of Visitors, which is comprised of energy, environmental and natural
resources professionals in the midst of prestigious careers. For more information, visit
