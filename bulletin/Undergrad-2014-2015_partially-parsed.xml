		The University has comprehensive programs for assessment of student learning at the 
		institutional, program and course levels. At the institutional level, assessment is 
		conducted through several programs: 
		•  Mission Statement Assessment Project (MSAP) relies on scores obtained from a 
		standardized exam that is administered to students at the beginning and end of 
		their undergraduate tenure. 
		•  Tulsa University Learning Assessment Project (TULAP) uses faculty-developed, 
		evaluative instruments (rubrics) to analyze student work that is produced in the 
		general curriculum courses. National Survey on Student Engagement (NSSE) and 
		Faculty Survey on Student Engagement (FSSE) obtain experiential and perception 
		information from freshmen and seniors and the faculty who teach both groups. 
		•  End-of-semester, online student evaluations provide faculty with perceptions about 
		students’ experiences in their courses. 
		These initiatives provide a systematic way of determining students’ ability to 
		demonstrate the skills, knowledge, and competencies that are included in the TU 
		Mission Statement.  
		Both TULAP and MSAP gather assessment data on several student learning 
		outcomes included in the University’s mission statement; consequently, it is important 
		that every undergraduate student has the possibility of participating in these programs. 
		Student confidentiality is ensured by presenting test results in aggregate and by 
		removing all identifiers from course-embedded artifacts prior to review. Assessment is 
		also done at the college and academic department levels measuring the increasingly 
		focused missions of these smaller units. The goal is to ensure that at every level the 
		mission of the University is achieved, and to find ways to continually improve the 
		curriculum, teaching and student achievement.

			<b>Board of Trustees  </b>
		
		The University of Tulsa’s Board of Trustees consists of active members and emeritus 
		members. Members hold office for a term of two or three years and election of 
		approximately one-third of the total membership is held each year. With certain 
		exceptions, no trustee except the President may serve more than two consecutive terms, 
		but a trustee who has served two consecutive terms (a total of 6 consecutive years) is 
		eligible for reelection after one year off. The President of the Tulsa Alumni Board and 
		President of the National Alumni Board serve during the term of that office. Both 
		active and emeritus trustees are elected by a majority vote of the Board of Trustees, 
		which determines the terms, conditions, and qualifications of membership.

		The University of Tulsa 
			
  
			
  
		As a comprehensive, doctoral-degree-granting institution with a covenant relationship 
		to the Presbyterian Church (USA), The University of Tulsa provides undergraduate, 
		graduate, and professional education of the highest quality in the arts, humanities, 
		sciences, business, education, engineering, law, nursing, and applied health sciences, and 
		participates in NCAA Division I. Its current undergraduate enrollment is about 3,400, 
		with about 1,100 students in its graduate programs and law. The University operates on 
		a semester basis.  
		The University campus lies two miles east of downtown Tulsa, a handsome, vigorous, 
		southwestern city in a metropolitan area of just under a million people, set in 
		northeastern Oklahoma’s “Green Country.” From the beginning, Tulsa’s founders — 
		who developed a thriving economy based on oil and gas, aerospace technology, 
		telecommunications, and health care — invested in nationally noted museums, 
		outstanding performing arts groups, and a system of parks and recreational facilities for 
		citizens of all ages. The city’s remarkable cultural, technological, and economic 
		resources nourish the University’s mission and enrich its life, just as the University, in 
		turn, enriches the city.  
		The University’s mission is further nurtured and supported by: 
		•  Exceptional faculty who draw students into the pursuit of knowledge and who 
		include in their numbers the 1998-99 Carnegie Foundation Professor of the Year 
		for all U.S. doctoral and research universities, a national Carnegie Foundation Pew 
		Scholar, a Carnegie Foundation Professor of the Year for Oklahoma, and four 
		Fellows of the Institute for Advanced Study; 
		•  A humanities-based general curriculum that stimulates scientific, social, and artistic 
		inquiry, while stressing competence in oral and written communication; 
		•  Graduate, professional, and research programs that foster advanced theoretical 
		development, promote professional preparation, enhance the quality of the faculty, 
		and extend the University’s international reach; 
		•  Substantial library resources and information technology that support research and 
		classroom learning; 
		•  A world-class museum that houses notable American western art, Native American 
		art, ethnographic holdings on indigenous peoples of the Americas, and documents 
		on the settlement of the New World; 
		•  A residential campus that fosters a sense of community and integrates curricular 
		and extracurricular life; 
		•  An urban arts center in downtown Tulsa’s historic Brady District; and 
		•  Abundant opportunities for students to undertake community service, internships, 
		and study abroad and to participate in substantive research, often as early as the 
		freshman year.

		History of The University of Tulsa 
		7 
			
  
		The University of Tulsa — a private, non-sectarian institution that has a mutually 
		articulated covenant with the Presbyterian Church (USA) — has its roots in the 
		Presbyterian School for Indian Girls, a small boarding school founded in 1882 in 
		Muskogee, Indian Territory. In 1894, at the request of the Synod of Indian Territory, 
		the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church elevated the academy’s status 
		and chartered it as Henry Kendall College, a coeducational institution whose name 
		honored the first General Secretary of the Home Missions Board. The first classes in 
		the new college were held on September 12, 1894.  
		In the years following, financial difficulties prompted school officials to ask the Synod 
		of Indian Territory to assume control, sell the school’s land, and seek a new location. 
		Successfully courted by the business and professional community of Tulsa which was 
		booming after the discovery of oil at Glenpool, Henry Kendall College moved to Tulsa 
		in 1907, the year of Oklahoma’s statehood.  
		Several years later, a new college, to be named after oilman Robert M. McFarlin, was 
		proposed for the city. Aware that Tulsa was not large enough to support two competing 
		colleges, the Henry Kendall College trustees proposed that the contemplated McFarlin 
		College and Kendall College affiliate under the common name “The University of 
		Tulsa.” A charter for the University was approved on November 9, 1920. In 1926, the 
		articles of incorporation were amended to create its modern structure as an independent 
		school corporation governed by a self-perpetuating Board of Trustees.  
		In 1928, the School of Petroleum Engineering opened and soon earned international 
		recognition for its curriculum and faculty. The College of Business Administration was 
		established in 1935. In 1943, the downtown law school, previously affiliated only 
		loosely, became part of the University.  
		Upon his death in 1966, James A. Chapman bequeathed the University $34 million in 
		endowment. In the 1970s, the Dimensions for a New Decade campaign raised an 
		additional $43 million. By the beginning of 2006, total endowment funds and funds held 
		in trust exceeded $800 million.  
		The University currently comprises the Henry Kendall College of Arts and Sciences, 
		the Collins College of Business (renamed in 2008), the College of Engineering and 
		Natural Sciences, the College of Law, the Graduate School, and the Division of Lifelong 
		Learning. The inauguration of a new College of Health Sciences is planned for 2015. 
		After the 1970s, the character of the University changed. Although the programs in 
		engineering and geosciences continued to bring the institution international renown, 
		carefully selected graduate programs were added in other fields; the College of Law, the 
		Collins College of Business, and the Henry Kendall College of Arts and Sciences were 
		strengthened; the number of students living on campus significantly increased; and the 
		student body — which currently hails from 44 states, the District of Columbia, and 71 
		different countries — became increasingly diverse.  
		In 1984, the University established an innovative humanities-based general course of 
		study called the Tulsa curriculum that emphasized the development of core skills in 
		writing, mathematics, and foreign languages; increased faculty diversity; enhanced its 
		support for excellent teaching and research; defined its academic programs with greater

		rigor and clarity; and began recruiting highly qualified students nationwide. In addition, 
		ten endowed chairs for faculty were established. (To date, 53 chairs, professorships and 
		deanships have been created.) The library was strengthened by accelerated development 
		of the rare book and manuscript collections, which regularly draw international scholars 
		and archival materials to the University, expanding the University’s reputation as the 
		home of one of the leading special collections libraries in the country and bringing 
		international acclaim. In 1988, the University was awarded the Beta of Oklahoma 
		chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, recognizing the University’s excellence in and commitment 
		to liberal arts education for all students. These trends have continued into the present, 
		advancing the University’s reputation for excellence.  
		As the University continued into its second century, it completed its most ambitious 
		capital campaign in its history, the New Century Campaign. Construction of the Donald 
		W. Reynolds Center, a $28 million, 138,000-square foot facility with an 8,000-seat arena, 
		was completed in 1999 with major funding in the form of a $14.75 million grant from 
		the Reynolds Foundation. Several new buildings located west of Delaware Avenue 
		constitute the Donna J. Hardesty Sports Complex. Completed in 2001, the Michael D. 
		Case Tennis Center includes a 64,000-square-foot indoor facility with six courts. In 
		addition, there are 12 outdoor courts with stadium seating around the four center 
		courts. For student recreation, the Fulton and Susie Collins Fitness Center, a 67,000 
		square foot multipurpose recreation center, opened in the fall of 2002. The Hardesty 
		complex also includes the Hurricane Soccer/Track Facility and a new softball park. 
		Construction of the $10.5 million Mabee Legal Information Center for the College of 
		Law was completed in January 2000. Another addition to the College of Law is the 
		4,000-square-foot Boesche Legal Clinic. These facilities are heavily used by both the 
		University and larger communities.  
		During the past decade, the University has made a commitment to developing a 
		vibrant residential campus environment, which includes the addition of more than 800 
		market-quality apartments since 2001. The University constructed the University Square 
		and Norman Village apartments in the northwest section of campus, Brown Village, 
		Lorton Village, and Mayo Village along the southern and eastern sections of campus, 
		and the West Park apartment building at East 4
		th
		 Place and South Lewis Avenue.  
		The campus has continued its dramatic physical transformation during the past few 
		years as TU completed a number of major construction projects including Bayless Plaza, 
		home of TU’s iconic Kendall Bell; Collins Hall, home to the admission, financial aid, 
		alumni relations, and central administration offices; the Case Athletic Complex, which 
		houses the Golden Hurricane football offices and provides academic study resources 
		for all TU student athletes; a complete renovation of H.A. Chapman Stadium to 
		enhance the football game day experience; and a new south entrance along Eleventh 
		Street that provides a grand front door to the University including Tucker Drive, 
		Chapman Commons, and the Genave King Rogers Fountain. A 12,000-square foot, 
		two-story addition to McFarlin Library was completed in 2009 and houses its computer 
		labs and student technology resources.  This project also included the restoration of the 
		library’s historic reading rooms and the addition of new amenities including the Cort 
		and Martha Dietler Café. The Pat Case Dining Center and refurbished student 
		residences in Fisher Hall, both completed during the summer of 2010, have dramatically 
		improved the appearance and functionality of these spaces in Fisher Hall.

		The Roxana Rózsa and Robert Eugene Lorton Performance Center, a 77,000-square-
		foot facility showcasing TU’s fine and performing arts, was completed in 2011. The 
		centerpiece of the Lorton Performance Center is the Gussman Concert Hall which 
		includes a full performance stage. The facility is the new home of the School of Music 
		and the Department of Film Studies. In October, 2010, ground was broken on a new 
		engineering complex surrounding a new academic quadrangle called Samson Plaza. The 
		J. Newton Rayzor Hall, home to electrical and computer engineering and computer 
		science, opened in November 2011. Stephenson Hall, which houses mechanical 
		engineering and the MacDougal School of Petroleum Engineering, opened in the fall of 
		2012.  
		On May 10, 2008, The University of Tulsa renamed the College of Business 
		Administration as the Collins College of Business to honor the vision and leadership of 
		Tulsa businessman Fulton Collins, who chaired the TU Board of Trustees from 1997 to 
		2008. The business building was renamed Helmerich Hall in 2008 in honor of Walt 
		Helmerich, Chairman of the Board and Director of Helmerich &amp; Payne, Inc.  
		In October, 2007, the City of Tulsa and TU agreed to an historic public-private 
		partnership under which TU manages operations at Tulsa’s Gilcrease Museum, home to 
		the world’s largest, most comprehensive collection of art and artifacts of the American 
		West. The partnership, which formally began on July 1, 2008, has resulted in numerous 
		strategic opportunities for the museum, including streamlining its management 
		structure, advancing and preserving the collection, and providing unparalleled 
		opportunities for academic research of the museum’s extensive holdings. The Gilcrease 
		partnership allows TU to leverage its nationally recognized academic resources in 
		western American history, art history, anthropology, and archaeology to create a better 
		understanding of the museum collection. The Helmerich Center for American 
		Research, opening in 2014, enhances scholarly opportunities at the Gilcrease Museum. 
		The University of Tulsa is engaged in a partnership with the University of Oklahoma 
		to participate in the Tulsa School of Community Medicine, with the first class planned 
		for the fall of 2015. The School will address the needs of the Tulsa urban and 
		Oklahoma rural communities that are underserved in medical and health care facilities 
		by training doctors who are committed to the public health issues of these populations.  
		In addition to supporting the traditional liberal arts, the University continues to 
		maintain and strengthen its academic standards by internationalizing its programs, 
		developing substantive undergraduate research opportunities, and seeking distinction in 
		critical fields, including environmental studies and research, computer security, 
		nanotechnology, bioinformatics, Native American and indigenous peoples law, risk 
		management, and taxation, the better to equip its students for life in a rapidly changing 
		world. A primary focus of the present administration is to elevate the University’s 
		regional accolades for excellence to national prominence. 
		As a mark of this success, since 1995, TU students have been successful with the 
		following national competitions: 59 Goldwater Scholarships, 54 National Science 
		Foundation Graduate Fellowships, 11 Truman Scholarships, 11 Phi Kappa Phi 
		Graduate Fellowships, 9 Department of Defense Fellowships, 17 Fulbright Grants, 9 
		Morris K. Udall Scholarships, 5 British Marshall Scholarships, and 11 Benjamin A. 
		Gilman Scholarships.

		.) The University of Tulsa uses a holistic approach in evaluating 
		candidates for admission based on available information, including academic and 
		extracurricular achievement, school records, and personal qualities. Admissibility is 
		determined by an admission committee under the auspices of the Dean of Admission. 
		Admission to certain degree programs may be limited and have additional academic 
		requirements or a separate program application. 
		The University has a non-binding Early Decision freshman admission plan with an 
		application deadline of November 1 and notification three weeks later. Applications 
		completed after November 1 will be reviewed under a rolling admission process and 
		applicants will be notified on an ongoing basis starting in mid-December. The priority 
		deadline for admission and scholarship consideration is February 1. The Office of 
		Admission also adheres to the national Candidate’s Reply Date, which means that 
		applicants are not required to pay a non-refundable enrollment deposit nor accept an 
		offer of admission or financial aid prior to May 1. Students notified of acceptance after 
		May 1 for the fall semester, or after December 1 for the spring semester, should make 
		their admission deposit within two weeks of notification. The deposit is credited toward 
		first semester tuition and is non-refundable.  
		As a member of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, The 
		University of Tulsa fully subscribes to the Statement of Principles of Good Practices.

		available from the Office of Admission or from the program director.  
		
			<b>Transcripts.</b> Early Action applicants may be considered for admission on the basis 
		of official sixth semester high school transcripts; however, seventh semester transcripts 
		may be requested by the admission committee. The final official high school transcripts 
		of enrolling students must be submitted from the school directly to the Office of 
		Admission upon graduation. Non-submission will preclude students from enrollment in 
		subsequent terms.  
		Candidates for admission who have received a high school equivalency credential 
		based on the Test of General Educational Development (GED) must submit an official 
		report of their GED scores from the testing agency in addition to a final official 
		transcript of any course work completed in high school.  
		Transcripts of college credit earned concurrently with high school credit are not 
		required for an admission decision, but should be submitted from the credit granting 
		institution directly to the Office of Admission upon completion of the course work.  
		
			<b>Recommendation.</b> Freshmen who have graduated within two years prior to the 
		intended term of enrollment must provide a secondary school counselor’s evaluation 
		form.  
		
			<b>SAT or ACT.</b> Freshman applicants must provide official scores from the SAT 
		Critical Reading and Mathematics exams or the ACT exam. The Office of Admission 
		reserves the right to validate SAT and ACT results reported on the high school 
		transcript by requesting an official score report from the testing agency.  
		Applicants who are 25 or older are not required to submit SAT or ACT results. The 
		admission committee may request scores from college entrance exams, however, if 
		deemed necessary to evaluate the applicant’s qualifications.  
		
			<b>Green Card (PRA) Verification Form. </b>Applicants who have a green card 
		(Permanent Resident status) must submit a completed, signed and notarized 
		Verification Form along with a signed and notarized copy of both sides of the green 
		card. The Verification Form may be obtained from the Office of Admission, or online

		examinations, class rank, personal qualities, achievements, and recommendations. 
		Special talent, leadership, maturity, strength of character, perseverance, and initiative 
		evident through recommendations, extracurricular activities, personal interviews and the 
		application are also considered. Test scores of the middle fifty percent of the freshman

		Students who wish to pursue a degree at The University of Tulsa and who have 
		attended other accredited colleges or universities since graduating from high school 
		must apply as transfer students. This includes students who were previously enrolled at 
		The University of Tulsa and subsequently attended another institution.  
		The Office of Admission reserves the right to verify the authenticity of any 
		documents or statements provided as part of the application and to request additional 
		materials as needed to render an admission decision.  
		Students transferring in must complete a minimum of the last 45 hours of their 
		degree plan at The University of Tulsa. 
		
			<b>Application for Admission and Fee.</b> The transfer application form, including a 
		personal statement, must be signed and submitted to the Office of Admission the 
		semester before the beginning of the term in which enrollment is sought. Application 
		may be made either on-line at <i>http://apply.utulsa.edu</i> or via a traditional form. The 
		University of Tulsa also accepts and gives equal consideration to the Common 
		Application in lieu of its own form. The one-time, non-refundable application fee is 
		specified on page 32.  
		In addition to the undergraduate application for admission, transfer applicants to the 
		Athletic Training program, the Energy Management program, the School of Art, the

		attended could result in withdrawal of the application or offer of admission. Applicants 
		who have received a high school equivalency credential based on the Test of General 
		Educational Development (GED) must submit an official report of their GED scores 
		from the testing agency, in addition to an official transcript of any high school work 
		completed. Transfer students who have completed 48 or more semester hours of 
		college credit at the time of their application are exempt from submitting high school 
		transcripts or GED results unless requested by the admission committee.  
		
			<b>SAT or ACT.</b> Transfer students must provide official scores from the SAT Critical 
		Reading and Mathematics exams or the ACT exam unless they have completed more 
		than 30 semester hours of college work or are 25 years of age or older. Scores from 
		college entrance exams or additional placement testing may be required, however, if 
		deemed necessary to evaluate the applicant’s qualifications. The Office of Admission 
		reserves the right to validate SAT and ACT results reported on the high school 
		transcript by requesting an official score report from the testing agency.  
		
			<b>Green Card (PRA) Verification Form. </b>Applicants who have a green card 
		(Permanent Resident status) must submit a completed, signed and notarized 
		Verification Form along with a signed and notarized copy of both sides of their green

		. 
		
			<b>Interview.</b> A personal interview with an admission counselor is strongly 
		recommended.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Transfer Selection  </b>
			</i>
		
		Transfer admission decisions are based on the complete academic record of the 
		applicant, including all previous college work and, in some cases, high school transcripts 
		and college entrance exams. Factors such as motivation, maturity, strength of character, 
		perseverance, and accomplishments evident through the application, interview, and 
		other documentation will also be considered.  
		Transfer applicants must be in good standing at the institution last attended. A 2.75 
		all-college cumulative grade point average is recommended for consideration for 
		admission. 
		Applicants who have courses in progress at another institution the semester prior to 
		their expected entry term may be offered admission provisionally, pending receipt of 
		final official transcripts.  
		Transfer students who show academic promise but whose overall academic records 
		do not fit conventional standards for admission may be considered for admission on 
		probation. Under the terms of probation, credit hours may be limited, and the student 
		will be required to maintain a 2.0 cumulative grade point average during the first 
		semester. Transfer students admitted on probation are referred to the Center for 
		Student Academic Support (CSAS) for services to assist their transition.  
		Students who have been dismissed or suspended from any college or university may 
		not be considered for admission to The University of Tulsa until one calendar year has 
		elapsed. Transfer students who were dismissed from The University of Tulsa prior to 
		attending another college must petition the dean of their college of enrollment before 
		being considered for readmission. Credits earned at another college or university during 
		the dismissal period may not be applied toward a degree from The University of Tulsa

		unless approved by the readmitting dean.  
		Previous TU students who have not attended another institution since their last term 
		of enrollment at The University of Tulsa do not need to reapply for undergraduate 
		admission. They may be reinstated as continuing students by the Office of the Registrar 
		under the same status previously accorded them by their college advising office. 
		Continuing students who have been dismissed must petition their college dean for 
		readmission.  
		
			<b>Transfer Credit.</b> The college transcripts of admitted applicants are evaluated by the 
		advising office of each undergraduate college. Transfer applicants are notified in writing 
		of credit that will be accepted toward their intended degree plan at The University of 
		Tulsa. See page 24 for further clarification of the awarding of credit.

			<b>Undergraduate Education at The University of Tulsa  </b>
		
		
			<i>
				<b>Philosophy  </b>
			</i>
		
		Through a wide range of courses and modes of learning, undergraduate education at 
		The University of Tulsa challenges students to develop an appreciation of a liberal 
		education, a breadth of knowledge, and the reasoning and communication skills that will 
		enhance their ability to participate fully in contemporary society. Students not only 
		enjoy diverse opportunities to participate in the scholarly process but also, through 
		study in a major subject area or area of concentration, gain depth of understanding and 
		proficiency in a particular subject.  
		
			<i>
				<b>The Tulsa Curriculum  </b>
			</i>
		
		Every undergraduate must fulfill the requirements of the Tulsa Curriculum, which has 
		two parts: the core curriculum and the general curriculum. Most students complete the 
		Tulsa Curriculum before beginning the junior year. The University Curriculum 
		Committee exercises oversight of the Tulsa Curriculum.  
		
			<i>
				<b>The Core Curriculum  </b>
			</i>
		
		Core curriculum requirements in writing, mathematics, and languages include the 
		development of fundamental intellectual skills that are not only immediately useful in 
		helping students meet the requirements of general education courses but that also equip 
		them with basic competencies.  
		It is presumed that all undergraduates enter the University with adequate computer 
		skills. Short courses and workshops are available to students who want to improve their 
		computer skills. 
		
			<b>Writing.</b> All undergraduates must take at least two writing courses. Students in the 
		Henry Kendall College of Arts and Sciences take Exposition and Argumentation 
		(ENGL 1033) and a First Seminar (FS 1973). Students in the Collins College of 
		Business and the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences take Exposition and 
		Argumentation (ENGL 1033) and Writing for the Professions (ENGL 3003). Non-
		native speakers of English and other students who need developmental work in the 
		fundamentals of writing, as evidenced by their test scores and performance on a 
		diagnostic writing test, are required to enroll in Introduction to College Writing (ENGL 
		1004) as a prerequisite for ENGL 1033. Total: 6-10 hours.  
		
			<b>Mathematics.</b> All incoming undergraduates must complete, place out of, or show 
		proficiency in Contemporary Mathematics (MATH 1083) or another basic mathematics 
		course certified by the University Curriculum Committee such as Mathematics with 
		Applications (MATH 1093), Basic Calculus (MATH 1103), or Pre-Calculus 
		Mathematics (MATH 1163). Total: 0-3 hours.  
		Bachelor of Science students have additional requirements in math and computer 
		science or computer applications.

		Academic Practices and Policies 
		19 
			
  
		For specific requirements of each degree program, consult the appropriate collegiate 
		advising office.  
		
			<b>Languages.</b> Students in many degree programs are required to take a foreign 
		language, as follows:  
		All Bachelor of Arts students must complete, place out of, or show proficiency in a 
		foreign language through the second-year level. Total: 0-14 hours.  
		All Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Music, and Bachelor of Music Education 
		students must complete or show proficiency in a foreign language through the first-year 
		level (1004-1014) and either continue the foreign language through the second level or 
		take two additional courses from Blocks I and II in the general curriculum. Total: 0-14 
		hours.  
		All Bachelor of Science in Business Administration students must complete, place out 
		of, or show proficiency in a modern foreign language through the first-year level (1004-
		1014). Total: 0-8 hours. The Collins College of Business offers a Bachelor of Science 
		degree in International Business and Language which, in addition to the business core, 
		requires language proficiency in French, German, Spanish, Russian or Chinese.  
		
			<i>
				<b>The General Curriculum  </b>
			</i>
		
		Because the development of knowledge involves collaboration with the past and 
		engagement with the present, the general curriculum, through the blocks defined below, 
		is structured to encourage this collaboration and engagement. Its goal is to lead students 
		to a breadth of knowledge and intellectual rigor rooted in the academic disciplines. 
		Reflecting the University’s commitment to writing through the curriculum, courses in 
		the general curriculum typically require significant amounts of writing. These courses 
		also emphasize original texts, wherever appropriate, as well as current scholarship.  
		The University schedule for each semester specifies course offerings in the general 
		curriculum. In meeting the general curriculum requirement, the student may take no 
		more than two courses from a single department. Course selection may be governed in 
		part by the student’s prospective major. Except for students in the College of 
		Engineering and Natural Sciences who are typically exempted from Block III, each 
		student must complete 25 hours of general curriculum courses: six from Block I, twelve 
		from Block II, and seven from Block III.  
		
			<b>Block I (AICE): Aesthetic Inquiry and Creative Experience (6 hours).</b> These 
		courses consider the human activities of making, thinking, and doing. Two different 
		approaches are offered: those that involve students in the creative process through 
		study in courses designed to produce or perform creative works; and those that 
		investigate the nature of texts, works of art or music, or systems of thought.  
		
			<b>Block II (HSI): Historical and Social Interpretation (12 hours).</b> These courses 
		investigate and interpret how human thought and action — and the products of such 
		thought and action — are shaped by social, historical, cultural, environmental, and/or 
		psychological factors.

		The University of Tulsa 
			
  
			
  
		
			<b>Block III (SI): Scientific Investigation (7 hours).</b> These courses focus on 
		methods of investigation and explore the relationships among key concepts in the 
		sciences. The process of scientific inquiry — including hypothesis generation, data 
		collection, analysis, and modeling, use of technology and mathematics, and presentation 
		of results — is fundamental to courses in this block. These courses may also consider 
		the interrelationships among technical concepts and contemporary societal issues. At 
		least one of each student’s Block III courses must include laboratory or field 
		experiences that provide practical experience in inquiry.  
		
			<b>Senior Requirement.</b> Most undergraduates at The University of Tulsa complete 
		their course of study with an intensive, rigorous, semester-long academic experience in 
		the senior year. The nature of this requirement varies by discipline and may be a design 
		project, a recital, an internship, or a specially designed interdisciplinary or major course. 
		To determine the appropriate senior requirement, students should consult their faculty 
		advisors or collegiate advising offices.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Honors Program  </b>
			</i>
		
		The Honors Program engages students in the critical examination of perennial questions 
		and big ideas that thinkers have tackled across time and across cultures. Honors 
		Scholars begin with a set of integrated Honors seminars. Taking one Honors Seminar 
		each semester, students trace the development of the moral and political commitments, 
		religious practices, scientific achievements, and artistic sensibilities that shape our 
		modern world. These seminars, listed on page 84 of this <i>Bulletin</i>, feature lively discussion 
		and debate. Honors professors encourage students to think hard about difficult ideas, to 
		ask unsettling questions, to defend what they say with good reasons, and to write well.  
		Beyond the seminars, Honors Scholars develop their own Honors Portfolio. In it, 
		students deliberately reflect on their own scholarly development, identify areas and skills 
		they would like to further develop, and pursue that plan. The Honors Portfolio is 
		designed to foster both intellectual independence and close working relationships 
		between professors and students. Through it, students hone their own voices as public 
		intellectuals; they practice connecting their areas of expertise to pressing issues of the 
		day; and they continue to practice the art of conversation through the lively, 
		interdisciplinary exchange of ideas.  
		Each Honors Seminar counts toward one of the block course requirements that all 
		University of Tulsa students must fulfill. Honors Scholars may major in any academic 
		discipline offered by the University. 
		Students interested in the Honors Program submit a separate application to the 
		Honors Office. Students who are in the 95th percentile on national exams (ACT or 
		SAT), have a high school grade point average of at least 3.5, or are in the top 10 percent 
		of their graduating classes are strong candidates for admission.  
		An Honors Program scholarship is given annually to each participant. Information 
		about Honors Program scholarships may be found on page 52 in the Student Financial 
		Services section of this <i>Bulletin</i>. 
		Honors Suites are available to incoming Honors Scholars who would like to live with 
		other students engaged in the Honors curriculum. See page 38 in the Campus Housing 
		and Dining Section of this <i>Bulletin</i> for more information.

			<i>
				<b>Honor Societies  </b>
			</i>
		
		The University of Tulsa supports chapters of national honor societies that recognize the 
		hard work of our students.  
		
			<b>Phi Beta Kappa</b> is the oldest American honorary society, founded at the College of 
		William and Mary in 1776. The University of Tulsa chapter, Beta of Oklahoma, was 
		chartered in 1989. The chapter annually elects to membership students with 
		exceptionally strong records in the liberal arts and sciences. Election to membership in 
		Phi Beta Kappa is one of the highest academic honors and is almost universally 
		regarded as evidence of superior scholarly attainment.  
		Candidates for membership must be in their junior or senior year, must have attended 
		The University of Tulsa for a minimum of three semesters of full-time work, and must 
		be enrolled in a fourth semester of full-time work at TU. In addition, students must 
		have taken at least 90 hours of liberal arts courses (other than professional and applied 
		courses), demonstrating breadth as well as depth of course study. Other factors 
		influencing selection into membership include a high grade point average, two years of a 
		foreign language and a minimum math requirement of MATH 1103, Basic Calculus, or 
		two courses consisting of MATH 1163, Pre-Calculus, and another math or statistics 
		course at an equivalent level of difficulty.  
		The culmination of the year’s activities is the annual Initiation Ceremony, normally 
		held the evening before spring commencement. During this ceremony new student 
		members (“Members in Course”) and distinguished Alumni/ae and Honorary Members 
		are inducted in a formal and memorable ceremony that publicly recognizes and honors 
		each inductee. For additional information, contact Professor Lamont Lindstrom, 
		Department of Anthropology.  
		
			<b>Phi Kappa Phi</b> was founded in 1897 as the Lambda Sigma Eta Society at the 
		University of Maine. In 1900, the society added chapters at the Pennsylvania State 
		College (now Pennsylvania State University) and the University of Tennessee and was 
		renamed Phi Kappa Phi. The University of Tulsa chapter, chartered in 1990, is one of 
		over 250 chapters in the United States.  
		Phi Kappa Phi elects members from all recognized branches of academic endeavor. 
		Members are selected on the basis of high academic achievement and good character. 
		Inductees may include a maximum of ten percent of the graduate students in the 
		University, ten percent of all graduating seniors, and no more than five percent of 
		juniors. 
		TU students may also join honor societies, listed on page 66, for specific fields of 
		study, class or other criteria. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Study Abroad  </b>
			</i>
		
		
			<b>Center for Global Education.</b> The University of Tulsa is committed to offering its 
		undergraduate students an opportunity to acquire cross-cultural experience by spending 
		a term studying, interning, or conducting research overseas. The Center for Global 
		Education (CGE) advisors work closely with students to assist them in finding 
		appropriate programs which fit their academic needs as well as their personal and career 
		goals.  
		The Center for Global Education manages 12 reciprocal exchange partnerships with 
		universities abroad and has affiliation agreements with well-respected study abroad

		provider organizations which offer overseas study and internship opportunities to 
		students worldwide.  
		After meeting study abroad application requirements and with the approval of a 
		student’s College, students may choose to take courses abroad which may satisfy major, 
		minor, block, and elective credit and degree requirements.  
		Students from all disciplines are encouraged to consider applying to participate in a 
		program abroad. Federal financial aid and TU-sponsored scholarships are portable on 
		approved study abroad programs, keeping the cost for a program abroad relatively close 
		to the same cost as attending TU. A number of competitive study abroad scholarships 
		are available and students are encouraged to apply. For more details on TU’s programs 
		abroad, see page 45 of this <i>Bulletin</i> and contact the Center for Global Education at 918-

		The Center for Global Education administers the interdisciplinary Global Scholars 
		Program which is described on page 464 of this <i>Bulletin</i>. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Certificate Programs  </b>
			</i>
		
		Students in all three undergraduate colleges may complete certificate programs which 
		allow them to acquire proficiencies in a specialized area of study. Many of the hours that 
		count toward a certificate will also count toward the student’s general education and 
		major requirements or as electives. A certificate program may also function unofficially 
		as a minor. Certificates may be earned by individuals who already possess one or more 
		college degrees.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Air Force ROTC  </b>
			</i>
		
		By agreement with the United States Air Force, eligible full time students at The 
		University of Tulsa may participate in Oklahoma State University Air Force ROTC. 
		Cadets participating in the crosstown program maintain their status as students at The 
		University of Tulsa and graduate with full TU credentials; however, upon graduation, 
		they receive commissions as second lieutenants in the United States Air Force through 
		the DET 670 AFROTC program at OSU. To accommodate the schedules of crosstown 
		participants, AFROTC classes are typically held on Thursday afternoons and evenings 
		on the OSU campus in Stillwater, Oklahoma. 
		
			<b>Eligibility.</b> Students in any academic major, including graduate students (with a 
		waiver), may participate in the AFROTC program. A cadet must be a full time student, 
		a U.S. citizen, and less than age 30 in the year of commissioning (some exceptions 
		apply). A cadet must have a cumulative undergraduate GPA of at least 2.00. Other 
		eligibility requirements apply and are subject to change. 
		
			<b>Scholarships and Incentives.</b> Students may be eligible for scholarships offered by 
		OSU AFROTC. For more information on these opportunities, contact the AFROTC 
		Recruiting Flight Commander (RFC) at 405-744-7744, or visit <i>www.afrotc.com</i>. 
		
			<b>Obligation.</b> In most cases, students may try AFROTC by taking the freshman or 
		sophomore AFROTC courses without obligation. In most cases, students who 
		successfully complete the ROTC program become second lieutenants in the U. S. Air 
		Force with a four-year active duty service obligation. However, service obligations vary 
		with career assignments and may include commitment times longer than four years. 
		
			<b>The Air Force ROTC Curriculum.</b> Air Force ROTC courses are listed in the OSU 
		catalog as Aerospace Studies (AERO). Freshman and sophomore AFROTC classes are

		one credit hour, while junior and senior AFROTC classes are three credit hours. All 
		academic classes require the cadet to enroll in and attend a weekly Leadership 
		Laboratory (LLAB) period during which leadership and followership skills are taught 
		and emphasized. The Professional Officer Course (POC) portion of the AFROTC 
		program is offered to juniors and seniors who have committed to a four-year-post 
		graduation service commitment with the Air Force. Students also attend mandatory 
		field training encampment during the summer between their sophomore and junior 
		years.

			<i>
				<b>Student Responsibility  </b>
			</i>
		
		The University strives to provide stimulating instruction, rigorous curricula, and 
		challenging academic standards. Collegiate deans and academic advisors are willing to 
		help explain available options, describe requirements, and plan degree programs. 
		Nonetheless, students ultimately are responsible for proper enrollment, attainment of 
		acceptable academic standards, and fulfillment of graduation requirements. Students 
		who fail to maintain minimum standards are subject to probation or dismissal from the 
		University.  
		At the beginning of each semester and again before midterm, faculty have the 
		opportunity to report the names of students who are doing unsatisfactory work to the 
		collegiate advising office and the Center for Student Academic Support (CSAS). The 
		Center for Student Academic Support, as part of the University’s Retention Alert 
		Program, then notifies the students. At the first sign of academic difficulty, responsible 
		students should ask instructors for help and should seek the assistance of the collegiate 
		academic advisors and the Center for Student Academic Support.  
		
			<b>Academic Standing  </b>
		
		
			<i>
				<b>Academic Advising  </b>
			</i>
		
		All students are advised through the college in which they are enrolled. In some cases 
		academic advising is coordinated by a professional advising staff, but in all colleges 
		faculty members work closely with students to assist in selecting courses and eventual 
		majors. In many cases, faculty advisors also help students plan for graduate and 
		professional school. Academic advising has a high priority at The University of Tulsa, 
		and students are expected to see their advisors each term before enrolling. For further 
		information on advising, see page 56 in the Advising and Support section of this <i>Bulletin</i>. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Classification  </b>
			</i>
		
		Students are classified on the basis of the number of credit hours earned. The 
		classifications used are: 
		•  0-29 hours - Freshman 
		•  30-59 hours - Sophomore 
		•  60-89 hours - Junior 
		•  90+ hours - Senior

		The University of Tulsa 
			
  
			
  
		A student must be enrolled in at least 12 semester hours of work to be considered a 
		full-time student. Enrollment in more than 18 hours during a semester requires special 
		permission from the dean of the college. Additional tuition will be charged for each 
		semester hour over 18.  
		Course classifications are:  
		•  1000 - Freshman level 
		•  2000 - Sophomore level 
		•  3000 - Junior level 
		•  4000 - Senior level 
		•  5000 - Advanced Senior level courses taken with advisor consent only  
		The last digit of the course number indicates the number of credit hours for that course. 
		One credit hour is the equivalent of 750 minutes in the classroom. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Credit by Examination  </b>
			</i>
		
		The maximum amount of credit towards a baccalaureate degree that may be awarded by 
		examination is 36 hours. This may be awarded under any combination of the following 
		four types of credit by examination programs.  
		
			<b>Advanced Placement Examinations.</b> The University participates in the College 
		Entrance Examination Board’s program of Advanced Placement (AP) examinations, 
		which allows high school students to earn college credit. Official test scores must be 
		forwarded directly from the Educational Testing Service to the Registrar. AP exam 
		score requirements for credit may be obtained through the Office of Admission. 
		
			<b>Proficiency Examinations.</b> A program of advanced standing gives exceptionally 
		qualified students a chance to earn credit by proficiency examinations. In order to be 
		eligible to receive University of Tulsa credit through this program, students must be 
		currently enrolled at the University. Proficiency tests are administered by University 
		faculty only after the application has been completed in the Office of the Registrar and 
		the required fee paid in the Bursar’s Office. The cost of proficiency examinations is 
		specified on page 33 in the Tuition and Fees section of this <i>Bulletin</i>. 
		
			<b>International Baccalaureate Program (IB).</b> The University of Tulsa will award 
		students who complete the IB Diploma with a score of 28 or above at least 30 credits. 
		Credit will also be awarded on a sliding scale to students completing the IB Diploma 
		with a score below 28. Students should consult the collegiate advising offices for details. 
		A list of courses credited for IB Examinations is available from the Office of the 
		Registrar or the Office of Admission. Final determination of hours awarded is at the 
		discretion of the collegiate advisor. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Transfer Credit  </b>
			</i>
		
		Credit earned at other institutions is evaluated after admission by the academic advisors 
		in the college of enrollment. Transfer applicants will be notified in writing of their 
		advanced standing and the number of hours remaining to complete a degree or 
		certificate program at The University of Tulsa.  
		Transfer work taken while a student at The University of Tulsa must be approved by 
		the advisor in the student’s collegiate office prior to enrollment at the other university. 
		Courses repeated at another institution do not count for University of Tulsa credit

		without prior approval from the appropriate collegiate dean. The grade previously 
		earned at The University of Tulsa will remain on the student’s transcript and continue 
		to be part of the student’s grade point average. Failure to receive prior approval from 
		the dean’s office will result in work not being transferable to TU.  
		Transfer credit will be granted only for courses offered during a regular semester with 
		a minimum three week term, and consistent with applicable academic standards of The 
		University of Tulsa and its academic programs.  
		Course work taken from accredited institutions and in which a grade of C or better 
		was earned is generally transferable. However, the total number of hours accepted in 
		transfer may be higher than those accepted for a specific college or degree. Academic 
		advisors in each college apply faculty policy to determine which courses apply towards 
		the degree requirements and which would be considered “overage” (not applicable) in a 
		chosen major. Consequently, the advising office of each college is responsible for 
		informing the student of the difference between the number of hours transferred into 
		TU and those hours applicable toward the anticipated degree program.  
		Exceptions and policy on the transfer of collegiate requirements must be approved by 
		the college dean. Credit is not granted for correspondence work. Experiential work will 
		not be accepted in transfer. Community college work may not account for more than 
		one-half the hours required for graduation from the University. The last 45 hours of 
		course work must be completed in residence at The University of Tulsa.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Probation  </b>
			</i>
		
		Student academic performance is reviewed at the end of every fall and spring semester. 
		Any student whose cumulative University of Tulsa grade point average falls below 2.0 
		(C) is automatically placed on probation. A student on academic probation may be 
		required to make up course deficiencies, accept limitations on enrollment, or abide by 
		limitations on extracurricular activities, as determined by the dean of the college in 
		which the student is enrolled.  
		In order to be removed from academic probation, students must raise their University 
		of Tulsa cumulative grade point average to 2.0 and fulfill any other conditions imposed 
		by the dean. The decision to remove a student from academic probation may be made 
		only by the dean of the college in which the student is currently enrolled. Students may 
		ask to be removed from probation at the end of a summer session if they have raised 
		their cumulative grade point average at The University of Tulsa to at least 2.0. Students 
		placed on probation cannot be removed from probation with work taken outside The 
		University of Tulsa.  
		A student may be placed on probation or dismissed from a college by the dean of that 
		college for reasons other than poor grades, even if he or she is in good academic 
		standing otherwise. This includes, but is not limited to, the falsification of application 
		materials including academic records, failure to satisfy stipulations imposed upon 
		admission to the program, failure to maintain the standards of academic, ethical, or 
		professional integrity expected in a particular discipline or program, and failure to satisfy 
		these or other program or college requirements in a timely fashion.

			<i>
				<b>Dismissal  </b>
			</i>
		
		Students who remain on probation for two consecutive semesters are subject to 
		dismissal from the University. Those who fail more than 50 percent of their grade point 
		hours or earn a grade point average of 1.0 or lower for any academic year are subject to 
		dismissal even if they have not been on probation previously.  
		Dismissal decisions are made by a student’s collegiate dean based on the student’s 
		academic performance. Extenuating circumstances may cause a collegiate dean to place 
		or continue a student on probation. If the collegiate dean elects to continue a student 
		on probation for additional semesters, the dean has the option of dismissing the student 
		at the end of any subsequent regular semester that the student continues to be on 
		probation. No student may continue on probation for more than four consecutive 
		semesters.  
		A student dismissed for academic reasons cannot under normal circumstances be 
		readmitted to The University of Tulsa until one calendar year has elapsed since the last 
		term in which the student was registered. Readmission requires permission from the 
		dean of the readmitting college. Credit earned at another college or university by a 
		student during the dismissal period is not applied for credit toward a degree from The 
		University of Tulsa unless approved by the readmitting dean.  
		
			<b>Baccalaureate Degrees  </b>
		
		
			<i>
				<b>Degrees Awarded </b>
			</i>
		
		The University of Tulsa offers the following undergraduate degrees: Bachelor of Arts 
		(B.A.), Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.), Bachelor of Arts in Deaf Education (B.A.D.E.) 
		Bachelor of Music (B.M.), Bachelor of Music Education (B.M.E.), Bachelor of Science 
		(B.S.), and Bachelor of Science in the following fields: Applied Mathematics (B.S.A.M.), 
		Athletic Training (B.S.A.T.), Business Administration (B.S.B.A.), Biochemistry (B.S.B.), 
		Chemical Engineering (B.S.Ch.E.), Chemistry (B.S.C.), Computer Science (B.S.C.S.), 
		Deaf Education (B.S.D.E.), Speech-language Pathology (B.S.S.P.), Electrical and 
		Computer Engineering (B.S.E.C.E.), Electrical Engineering (B.S.E.E.), Geosciences 
		(B.S.G.S.), Exercise and Sports Science (B.S.E.S.S.), Information Technology (B.S.I.T.), 
		International Business and Language (B.S.I.B.L.), Mechanical Engineering (B.S.M.E.), 
		Nursing (B.S.N.), Petroleum Engineering (B.S.P.E.), Engineering Physics (B.S.E.P.), 
		Biogeosciences (B.S.B.G.), and Geophysics (B.S.G.P.).  
		
			<i>
				<b>Degree Requirements  </b>
			</i>
		
		All degrees are awarded by a vote of the University’s Board of Trustees upon 
		recommendation by the faculty. Students must complete their prescribed curricula with 
		at least a 2.0 (C) grade point average in order to become candidates for a degree and 
		must meet the additional degree requirements of their college. Transfer students must 
		have at least a 2.0 (C) grade point average in work taken at The University of Tulsa.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Special Considerations </b>
			</i>
		
		
			<b>Minimum Hours Required. </b>All undergraduate degrees from The University of Tulsa 
		require a minimum of 124 hours for completion. Depending upon the major, students 
		in the Henry Kendall College of Arts and Sciences must complete between 124 and 131 
	</page>
	<page number="37" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
		Academic Practices and Policies 
		27 
			
  
		credit hours to graduate. In the Collins College of Business, the minimum ranges 
		between 124 and 126 credit hours; and in the College of Engineering and Natural 
		Sciences, the minimum ranges between 124 and 134 credit hours. For further 
		information on these minimums, consult the appropriate collegiate advising office.  
		The last 45 semester hours in any degree program (major) must be completed in 
		residence.  
		
			<b>Double Majors.</b> Students who wish to major in two different fields may do so by 
		completing the minimum number of hours for each major. Double majors may be 
		pursued either in one college or in two different colleges, but in the latter case, the 
		permission of the deans of both colleges must be obtained at the time the second major 
		is declared. 
		
			<b>Double Degrees.</b> Normally, to receive a second Bachelor’s degree, a student needs 
		to fulfill the minimum number of hours/specific requirements for each degree program. 
		Credit hours may be applied to more than one degree program only with permission 
		from the dean of the college in which the degree program is offered. 
		
			<b>Graduation Check.</b> A graduation check is made in the first semester of the senior 
		year by the collegiate advising office to ensure that all degree requirements will be met 
		in a timely manner. When a student completes all degree requirements, the student will 
		graduate at the end of the semester in which all requirements were met. Students must 
		file a degree card with the collegiate advising office at the time of registration for the 
		final semester. Confirmation of candidacy must be obtained from that office and 
		forwarded to the Registrar. The University will confer a degree on a student who has 
		completed all of the requirements for the degree even though the student has not 
		applied for graduation. 
		
			<b>Commencement Participation.</b> The University holds commencement ceremonies 
		in December and May. Students who complete degree requirements in the fall are to 
		participate in that year’s December commencement, and those completing their 
		requirements in the spring are to participate in commencement that May. In the spring 
		semester, students in good standing who lack up to 12 hours of course work that they 
		have enrolled to complete in the upcoming summer session are permitted to take part in 
		the May commencement. Any exceptions to this policy must be cleared by the 
		appropriate collegiate dean. Honors will not be called for students graduating during the 
		summer, and are called for fall and spring graduates based upon the cumulative GPA 
		earned as of the end of the prior regular term.  
		
			<b>Teacher Education.</b> Programs in teacher education are offered through the Henry 
		Kendall College of Arts and Sciences. Students interested in teacher education should 
		consult the certification advisor in the School of Urban Education and refer to teacher 
		education requirements beginning on page 128 in the School of Urban Education 
		section of this <i>Bulletin</i>. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Graduation with Honor</b>
			</i>
		
		Students who maintain a 4.0 grade point average in all undergraduate courses taken at 
		TU graduate summa cum laude; those with a 3.8 or higher, magna cum laude; and those 
		with a 3.5 or higher, cum laude. These designations appear on the official transcript and 
		on the diploma.

			<b>Rules and Regulations  </b>
		
		
			<i>
				<b>Grading System  </b>
			</i>
		
		The following grades are assigned: A (superior), B (above average), C (average), D 
		(below average), P (pass), I (incomplete), F (failure), W (withdrew), AU (audit), and MG 
		(missing grade).  
		
			<b>Policy on Incomplete Grades.</b> Undergraduate students who are doing passing work 
		but who, because of serious illness or other legitimate extenuating circumstances, 
		cannot complete their course work may, at the discretion of the instructor, receive a 
		grade of I (incomplete). Incompletes will not be granted without an exceptionally good 
		reason to students who have been absent excessively during the term nor to students 
		who have merely failed to complete course work.  
		When the instructor grants an incomplete, a Record of Incomplete form must be 
		completed and filed in the office of the undergraduate dean. This form, which is to be 
		signed by the instructor and student, should specify what must be done to remove the 
		incomplete and give a deadline for the completion of the unfinished work. The contract 
		will be attached to the course grade report for inclusion in the student’s official file in 
		the Office of the Registrar.  
		The incomplete grade will remain on the student record for no more than one year. 
		After that time, unless the course work is completed or the instructor is able to assign a 
		grade, the Office of the Registrar will change the I to an F. Students with more than 
		nine credits of I will not be permitted to enroll in courses at the University without the 
		permission of the office of the collegiate dean.  
		
			<b>Pass-Fail Option.</b> Subject to certain restrictions, each college allows students to take 
		a limited number of courses on a pass-fail basis. For regular term courses the request 
		must be made in writing to the collegiate advising office within the first three weeks of 
		the term. For short courses (including summer terms) the deadlines are based on one 
		day for each week of class time, for example, a request must be made within the first six 
		days of a six-week term. Deadlines for declaring this option are not subject to change. 
		For further limitations imposed by a particular college, consult the office of the 
		collegiate dean. Grades of C or better in such courses will be recorded as P (pass). 
		Grades of D will be recorded as D and grades of F as F and are calculated in the grade 
		point average. In a limited number of courses the only grade offered is Pass/D-F.  
		
			<b>Grade Point Averaging.</b> Grade points are computed as follows: four points for each 
		semester hour of A, three points for each semester hour of B, two points per hour of C, 
		one point per hour of D, and 0 points for F. The University offers a limited number of 
		courses graded as P/D/F only, with no option for an A, B, or other letter grade.  
		To determine a grade point average, total number of semester hours attempted at The 
		University of Tulsa are divided into the total number of grade points earned at The 
		University of Tulsa, except: (1) hours earned with a grade of P and grades designated as 
		I, AU, or N are omitted from this calculation, and (2) only the last grade earned when a 
		course has been repeated is used in the grade point calculation.  
		
			<b>Repeating a Course.</b> An undergraduate student may repeat a course up to two times 
		and will be charged the usual fees each time. Students are not allowed to repeat a course 
		in which they have an “incomplete” pending. Additional repeating of a course may be 
		allowed only with written approval from the dean of the student’s college of enrollment.

		Academic Practices and Policies 
		29 
			
  
		When a course is repeated, only the most recent grade earned in the course will be 
		included when calculating the student’s cumulative grade point average.  
		
			<b>Honor Rolls.</b> At the end of each semester, the President’s Honor Roll and the 
		Dean’s Honor Roll are determined based on current semester grades only. For the 
		Dean’s Honor Roll, the student must have at least twelve graded hours and at least a 
		3.500 term grade point average. The President’s Honor Roll requires at least twelve 
		graded hours and a term grade point average of 4.000. Graded hours include grades of 
		A, B, C, D, and F. Passes and incompletes are not included in graded hours. The 
		University does not round up grade point averages for these criteria to be met.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Excused Absences  </b>
			</i>
		
		Students who participate in an officially sanctioned, scheduled activity shall be given an 
		opportunity to make up exams or other assignments that are missed as a result of this 
		participation. The manner in which missed tests or other assignments are made up is 
		left to the discretion of each individual faculty member; however, students shall not be 
		penalized and should be informed of the instructor’s makeup policy, preferably in 
		writing, at the beginning of each semester. It is the responsibility of the student to make 
		arrangements with the instructor prior to the scheduled exam or other missed 
		assignment. Only absences reported by the Registrar to the faculty will be considered 
		excused.  
		Students who are absent for personal reasons (e.g., contagious illness requiring 
		quarantine, significant hospitalization, a death in the immediate family) are covered by 
		the Absence Notification Policy of the Center for Student Academic Support which 
		may be found on the CSAS website at 
		
			<i>http://www.utulsa.edu/CSAS</i>
		
		. All absences are 
		considered on a case-by-case basis by the instructor in accordance with the policies of 
		the academic unit and college. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Auditing  </b>
			</i>
		
		Students who elect to audit a course will have all the responsibilities and privileges of 
		students taking the course for credit, except those of taking the final examination or 
		receiving credit for the course. Auditors who have completed all other requirements for 
		a course may elect to take the course for credit at any time within the first three weeks 
		of a regular semester if the course instructor and the college dean give their permission. 
		The schedule for auditing courses during the summer term should be obtained from the 
		Office of the Registrar.  
		Students originally enrolled in a course for credit may elect to change their status to 
		that of auditor at any time within the first three weeks of a regular semester if they are 
		passing the course at the time that the change in status is requested, and if they secure 
		the consent of the course instructor. Students must complete a drop/add form and 
		secure permission from the collegiate dean in order to make such a change.  
		Students who enroll in a course for audit but fail to attend the class may be 
		withdrawn at the request of the instructor and the approval of the academic dean. The 
		University’s normal refund policy for withdrawals will apply.

			<i>
				<b>Withdrawal  </b>
			</i>
		
		
			<b>Voluntary Withdrawal from the University.</b> Official withdrawal from the University 
		requires a standard procedure originated through the office of the collegiate dean. It is 
		financially and academically advantageous to students to follow the official withdrawal 
		procedure. Students withdrawing prior to the start of the seventh week of a regular 
		semester are entitled to a partial refund of tuition calculated from the date of their 
		official withdrawal. <b>Nonattendance of classes does not constitute official </b>
		
		
			<b>withdrawal.</b>
		
		
			<b>Medical/Psychological Withdrawals or Leaves of Absence.</b>
		
			
  
		Students wishing to 
		withdraw or take a leave of absence from the University based on a medical or 
		psychological reason should contact the Center for Student Academic Support to 
		discuss their reasons for seeking a withdrawal or a leave of absence, the medical 
		documentation required, their plans while on leave, and to work out any conditions that 
		may be necessary for an easier transition back to The University of Tulsa. It should be 
		noted that a student may voluntarily withdraw before the twelfth week of classes 
		through the normal withdrawal process. The complete policies are available at the 
		Center for Student Academic Support or online at 
		
			<i>http://www.utulsa.edu/CSAS</i>
		
		.
			
  
		“W” grades will be assigned to all classes for the current semester if a 
		medical/psychological withdrawal is granted. Students who have not completed the 
		process will be assigned permanent grades by the instructor. Retroactive grade changes 
		are not permitted. 
		The Center for Student Academic Support will maintain all documentation in 
		confidential student files and will provide verification of appropriate documentation as 
		needed. A medical/psychological withdrawal does not negate the student’s financial 
		responsibility to the University. Students should contact the Bursar’s Office, Housing 
		and Dining, and/or Student Financial Services regarding outstanding fees, bills, refunds 
		and other charges related to their enrollment or withdrawal.  
		
			<b>Withdrawal from the University for Military Service. </b>Students who are called to 
		active military duty at any time during their enrollment will be eligible for a full refund 
		or credit of their tuition for the semester of their withdrawal. Students are strongly 
		encouraged to discuss their situation with their academic advisor to consider alternate 
		arrangements. For example, students who are called to report for active duty near the 
		end of a semester may choose to take “incompletes” in their courses, rather than 
		repeating the entire semester when they return to the University. The University will 
		work closely with students to minimize the impact a withdrawal will have on their 
		academic progress. All students called to active military duty are required to meet with 
		the Veteran’s Coordinator in the Office of the Registrar. 
		
			<b>Non-voluntary Withdrawal from the University.</b> Students may be required to 
		withdraw from the University for habitual absence from class, habitual idleness, or any 
		other behavior that prevents them from fulfilling the purposes implied by their 
		registration in the University. A grade of “W” will be entered for each of the courses in 
		which a student is registered. Students who have been required to withdraw must apply 
		for readmission to their dean in the same manner as that required of a suspended 
		student.

		Academic Practices and Policies 
		31 
			
  
		
			<b>Voluntary Withdrawal from a Course.</b> Withdrawal from a course prior to the start 
		of the fourth week of a regular semester is considered a cancellation of enrollment, and 
		the course is not shown on students’ academic records.  
		Withdrawal from a course after the start of the fourth week and up to and including 
		the twelfth week of a regular semester will be considered a partial enrollment for which 
		a grade of W (withdrew) will be recorded.  
		Withdrawals are not permitted after the end of the twelfth week of a regular semester. 
		The schedule for withdrawal from courses and refund of tuition is printed in the 
		schedule of courses for each semester. Any formal withdrawal shall constitute a 
		forfeiture of any and all right to the subsequent make-up of incomplete grades.  
		
			<b>Non-voluntary Withdrawal from a Course.</b> Students may be withdrawn from a 
		class for habitual behavior which prevents the student or other students from fulfilling 
		the purposes implied by registration in the University. A grade of “W” will be entered 
		for the course in which the student was registered.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Transfer of Records  </b>
			</i>
		
		The Office of the Registrar will forward official transcripts to other institutions or 
		prospective employers when requested by in writing students. Transcripts will not be 
		issued for students who have not met their financial obligations to the University.  
		The University does not issue unofficial transcripts or copies of transcripts from 
		other institutions.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Reading Days </b>
			</i>
		
		No academic activities including classes, labs, or assignments will be scheduled during 
		designated reading days prior to final exams at the end of each semester. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Academic Honesty  </b>
			</i>
		
		In keeping with the intellectual ideals, standards for community, and educational 
		mission of the University, students are expected to adhere to all academic policies. 
		Cheating on examinations, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty violate 
		both individual honor and the life of the community, and may subject students to 
		penalties ranging from failing grades to dismissal.  
		Academic misconduct also includes unauthorized or inappropriate use of University 
		computers, vandalism of data files or equipment, use of computer resources for 
		personal reasons unrelated to the academic and research activities of the University, 
		plagiarism, violation of proprietary agreements, theft, or tampering with the programs 
		and data of other users.  
		Specific policies exist in the various colleges in addition to the overall University 
		policies published in this <i>Bulletin</i> and other campus policy guides.

				<b>Payment of Accounts </b>

		It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that all educational expenses are paid during 
		the semester in which they are incurred. If financial aid does not cover all of the 
		student’s expenses, the student may pay the balance in full or participate in the 
		University of Tulsa’s monthly payment plan. Contact the Bursar’s Office, 918-631-2600, 
		or visit

			<i/>to 
		obtain information regarding the monthly payment plan. A nominal fee will be assessed 
		to establish a monthly payment plan.  
		Payment of current semester charges or payment arrangements must be made by 5:00 
		p.m. on the first day of classes. Payment arrangements may include the monthly 
		payment plan, pending financial aid, or a combination. Payments not made when due 
		will be subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month.  
		Currently enrolled students with an unpaid balance may be eligible to enroll in a 
		subsequent semester provided that:  
		•  The student balance is not in excess of $5,000.00; 
		•  The student balance includes current semester charges only; and 
		•  The student has established a University-approved payment plan, at least one 
		payment of that plan has been processed, and the terms of the payment plan allow 
		for payment in full of the current unpaid balance by the start of the semester in 
		which the student wishes to be enrolled. 
		A failed payment plan will result in cancellation of enrollment. If the account remains 
		unpaid, the University reserves the right to suspend or withdraw the student from 
		classes; to withhold grades, transcripts, and diplomas; deny future enrollments; and to 
		require the student to move from student housing. 
		The University accepts charges on valid Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or 
		Discover credit cards.

			<i>
				<b>Insurance and Immunization Requirements </b>
			</i>
		
		
			<b>Student Health Insurance. </b>All students enrolled at The University of Tulsa are 
		required to have health insurance coverage which provides for benefits in the State of 
		Oklahoma. A student may obtain required coverage by purchasing health insurance 
		coverage offered through the University, or obtain coverage provided through another 
		carrier, such as coverage under a dependent student’s parent’s policy, as long as that 
		coverage provides benefits for claims made in Oklahoma. If a student has a spouse 
		and/or dependents, the student may add coverage for them under the policy offered 
		through the University. 
		This approach to health insurance coverage helps to ensure that all enrolled students 
		have access to health care, especially as increasing numbers of TU students come from 
		outside of Oklahoma. To help ensure coverage, all students will have the cost of the 
		coverage available through the University added to their University bill each semester. 
		This charge is specified on page 33 of this <i>Bulletin</i>. However, the charge will be removed 
		from the student’s account upon verification of other appropriate coverage. Verification 
		must be received annually by September 15th for students enrolling in the fall semester 
		and January 31st for students enrolling for the first time in the spring semester. 
		
			<b>Student Renter’s Insurance. </b>Renter’s insurance is recommended for all students 
		living in on campus or other away-from-home accommodations. In many cases, parents’ 
		homeowner policies will cover expenses related to dependents’ expenses in external 
		locations. However, it is wise to conduct an insurance review to assure that a student 
		has the appropriate amount of coverage.  
		
			<b> Immunization Policy.</b> State law requires that all students who attend Oklahoma 
		colleges and universities provide written documentation of immunization against 
		hepatitis B, and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). Students who reside in on-campus 
		housing are also required to be immunized against meningococcal (meningitis) disease. 
		For more information on health services and immunization requirements, visit

		Alexander Health Center at 918-631-2241. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Parking and Bicycle Permits  </b>
			</i>
		
		All University students, faculty, and staff must register motor vehicles and bicycles 
		that are to be parked or utilized on University parking lots, streets or bicycle racks. 
		Parking permits and copies of parking regulations may be obtained from the Parking 
		and Card Services office located in Fisher Hall. Parking fees are specified on page 33 of 
		this <i>Bulletin</i> and at 
		
			<i>www.utulsa.edu/parking</i>
		
		. 
		
			<i>
				<b>TU One Card </b>
			</i>
		
		The Parking and Card Services office in Fisher Hall issues identification cards to all 
		students and University employees. The cards are required for admission to the campus 
		libraries, dining hall, residence halls, labs, selected classrooms and other facilities. 
		Whenever students are on University property or at University events, they are required 
		to carry their TU One Card and to present it to University officials to verify their 
		identity. ID cards may not be loaned to anyone at any time. Disciplinary action will be

		taken against a student who fraudulently uses another’s card, and against a cardholder 
		who permits fraudulent use of his or her card.  
		The TU One Card is used for admission to Student Association-sponsored programs 
		and University athletic events. All students at The University of Tulsa are allowed one 
		free student ticket to each athletic event. Students must present their valid University of 
		Tulsa ID and ticket for admittance to athletic events. For more information regarding 
		the athletic event ticket policy, visit

		.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Hurricane Gold Dollars </b>
			</i>
		
		Hurricane Gold Dollars is a safe and convenient option for on- and off-campus 
		dining and shopping. Hurricane Gold Dollars reduces the need to carry or keep cash on 
		hand. It is a non-interest-bearing declining balance convenience account, not a credit 
		card or a checking account, and is tied to a student’s TU One Card. Hurricane Gold 
		Dollars may be used at all campus dining locations, at the bookstore, in vending 
		machines and at many off-campus merchants and restaurants. 
		Purchases are deducted from the student’s account when the ID card is swiped at the 
		register. When the deposited limit is reached, a student may add funds to the card by 
		simply prepaying an amount ($25.00 or more) into the student’s Hurricane Gold Dollars 
		account at the Parking and Card Services office in Fisher Hall or in the Bursar’s Office 
		in McClure Hall. Students may also log on to 
		
			<i>www.MyGoldDollars.com</i>
		
		. 
		Banking regulations and University policy prohibit cash withdrawals during the 
		academic year, but remaining balances are fully refundable at the end of the spring 
		semester or upon withdrawal from the University. Requests for withdrawal of funds 
		must be presented in writing. 
		
			<b>If a student loses a TU One Card, especially when there is money in his or her </b>
		
		
			<b>Hurricane Gold or Dining Dollars account, he or she should notify the Parking </b>
		
		
			<b>and Card Services office immediately.</b> The student will be responsible for all 
		transactions made by the student or by anyone else who uses the card, even if lost. 
		However, to minimize loss, a $20.00 per day spending limit has been established for all 
		vending locations. The Parking and Card Services office will instantly change the 
		account number to protect the account from unauthorized use and will issue a 
		replacement TU One Card. The fee for a replacement card is specified on page 33 of 
		this <i>Bulletin</i>. 
		Loss of an ID after normal business hours can be reported to any Hurricane Gold 
		location with a cash register — e.g., the Hut or Pat Case Dining Center — which can 
		“lock out” use of the missing card. Then, when the Parking and Card Services office 
		reopens, the account number can be changed and the account reactivated. If this is not 
		convenient, the student should leave a message on the voice mail at the Parking and 
		Card Services office. Invalidation of the card will occur on the morning of the next 
		business day. The University of Tulsa is not responsible for cash balances of lost cards.

				<b>First- and Second-Year Residency/Dining Requirement  </b>
			</i>
		
		Retention research shows that living on campus can greatly enhance a student’s 
		educational experience and success. Thus, all first-year students are required to live in 
		University residence halls, second-year students must live on campus, and both must 
		participate in a University-provided meal plan unless they are formally exempted to 
		reside with parent(s) or legal guardian(s) in their primary residence within a 20 mile 
		radius of the campus. This policy applies to traditional first- and second-year post-high 
		school students, international students, and transfer students who have not completed 
		two years of residency at another university after high school. Married students and 
		students over 21 years of age prior to start of the license period are exempt. Academic 
		credit hours and/or class status do not exempt a student from the policy.  
		First- or second-year students under 21 years of age desiring to live at home with 
		parents/legal guardians or in fraternity housing should obtain and complete a Housing 
		Residency Form which may be found on the Housing and Dining website at 
		
			<i>www.utulsa.edu/student-life/living-and-dining-on-campus.aspx</i>
		
		. This form must be signed by 
		parents/legal guardians and notarized prior to submission. Requests for exemption 
		from this policy should be directed to Housing and Dining Services at 918-631-2516.

				<b>Campus Housing Facilities </b>
			</i>
		
		The University maintains the following residential facilities that are open to both 
		graduate and undergraduate students: Lottie Jane Mabee Hall for 287 women; John 
		Mabee Hall for 300 men; 5th Place House for 24 men and women; Fisher West Suites 
		for 300 men and women in single- and double-room suites; the International Living 
		Community comprises LaFortune House for 118 men and women on double- and 
		triple-room suites and 7th Street House for 37 men; and approximately 774 campus 
		apartments for upper class undergraduate students and graduate, law, married, and 
		nontraditional students. All campus housing has wireless computer network access, 
		expanded basic cable connection, laundry with no usage charge, as well as designated 
		study lounges and recreational/social areas. A reception desk is staffed in each living 
		area to provide information and to checkout recreational equipment to residents. 
		
			<b>Residence Directors.</b> Live-in professional staff members and student assistants 
		work with student hall governments and staff to schedule programs and activities each 
		semester and are available for general information, counseling, and referral assistance.  
		
			<b>Residence Hall Association.</b> All students living in University residence halls are 
		members of the Residence Hall Association (RHA), whose goal is the improvement of 
		the quality of life for resident students. RHA sponsors social, educational and 
		community service activities for students living in the halls and on a campus-wide basis. 
		RHA is hall government’s umbrella legislative body and represents student views to the 
		administration, develops policy recommendations, and plans educational and social 
		programs for all residence hall students. Each hall elects representatives to serve on the 
		legislative board, and executive officers are elected in an “all hall” election each spring 
		to serve the following academic year.

			<i>
				<b>Housing and Dining Application and Policy Information </b>
			</i>
		
		Students living in the residence halls or apartments are subject to the terms and 
		conditions of the <i>Campus Living </i>booklet, the <i>Student Handbook</i>, the <i>Undergraduate Bulletin</i>, 
		the <i>Graduate Bulletin</i> and the Housing and Dining Services application/license. The 
		housing and dining application/license extends for the entire academic year. Students 
		may also license for the summer period. If a student signs an application/license, the 
		student agrees to use said services for the duration of the license period unless he or she 
		either graduates in December or participates in a study abroad program. If a resident 
		desires to arrive prior to or remain past the selected license period, a request must be 
		made in writing and approved by the Office of Housing and Dining. Additional charges 
		will be assessed to the student’s account. The same rules apply to the dining portion of 
		the agreement. Requests for release from the Housing and Dining License must be 
		submitted in writing to the Housing and Dining Services office and must include 
		appropriate documentation. The decision as to the release will be at the University’s sole 
		discretion. The University may suspend participation in dining programs or remove 
		students from housing for failure to pay charges when due or if student conduct 
		problems arise. Review the Housing and Dining License Terms and Conditions for 
		more detailed information. 
		A one-time housing reservation fee/deposit must accompany each application. The 
		amount is specified on page 33 in the Tuition and Fees section of this <i>Bulletin</i>. In 
		accordance with student recommendations, the total deposit is held on account until 
		graduation or final departure from the University.

		semester. The agreement does not include meals during the summer term, holidays, or 
		vacation periods.

			</i>
		
		The Office of Student Financial Services uses the need analysis from the Free 
		Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to determine financial need. Students 
		must submit the FAFSA directly to the Department of Education. All information 
		contained in these credentials is held in strict confidence. Financial records are 
		protected in accordance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as 
		amended.  
		Financial need represents the difference between the cost of attending the University 
		and the amount that the student and the student’s family are expected to contribute 
		toward the educational costs. The Office of Student Financial Services carefully 
		considers the size of the family and its income, resources, and obligations in making an 
		assessment of the family’s contribution.  
		The factors considered in determining the types and amounts of aid received by an 
		applicant are: (1) the availability of funds; (2) the student’s analyzed financial need; and 
		(3) the student’s classification and record of academic performance.  
		
			<i>
				<b>For Best Consideration  </b>
			</i>
		
		Applications are available in January for the following academic year. The FAFSA 
		should be completed by March 1 for students to receive full consideration for all 
		assistance available.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Financial Aid Packaging  </b>
			</i>
		
		Packages of aid may consist of a combination of scholarship, grant, loan, and 
		employment. This aid packaging concept enables the University to make more funds 
		available to a larger number of applicants. The FAFSA form is recommended for 
		consideration of grants, loans, and part-time employment opportunities. Timely 
		submission of the FAFSA and all requested information is required to receive the 
		largest award possible. Recipients of federal aid must reapply each year to be considered 
		for continuation in the following year. Scholarship recipients will receive renewals based 
		on the criteria of the particular award.  
		The University of Tulsa reserves the right to reduce or rescind award packages if 
		federal allocations to the University are insufficient to cover expenditures.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Academic Requirements  </b>
			</i>
		
		All students who receive financial assistance must demonstrate the ability to do 
		satisfactory college work. High academic performance is usually required for scholarship 
		consideration.

		There are minimum academic course-load requirements for the various types of 
		financial assistance available through the Office of Student Financial Services. Students 
		must be full-time students to be considered for University-funded financial aid. Full-
		time enrollment is defined on page 24 of this <i>Bulletin</i>. Enrollment in audit classes does 
		not count toward eligibility for financial assistance.  
		Students receiving financial aid who reduce their course loads below the required 
		minimums after enrollment must inform the Office of Student Financial Services, which 
		may cancel awards at any time if students fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress 
		or minimum course-load requirements.  
		Students receiving University grants or University funds are required to maintain at 
		least a 2.0 cumulative grade point average. Scholarship grade point requirements vary 
		according to the type of scholarship. Inquiry should be made in the Office of Student 
		Financial Services as to the exact qualifications. 
		Transient students and those who attend summer term only are ineligible for financial 
		aid. All aid recipients must be admitted as regular students pursuing a degree program. 
		Eligibility for continued financial assistance depends upon maintaining “satisfactory 
		academic progress” and “good standing.” Students who do not meet satisfactory 
		progress and good-standing criteria may not be eligible for federal financial assistance 
		for the next academic period. If extenuating circumstances interfere or prevent students 
		from meeting these requirements, they should contact the Office of Student Financial 
		Services immediately.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) </b>
			</i>
		
		Federal regulations require that all recipients of student financial assistance make 
		satisfactory academic progress toward a degree or eligible certificate. Students applying 
		for assistance through the Federal Pell Grant, Federal SEOG, Federal Work Study, 
		TEACH Grant, Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grant (OTAG), Oklahoma Tuition 
		Equalization Grant (OTEG), Oklahoma’s Promise (OHLAP), Federal Perkins Loan, 
		Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, and Direct Parent 
		PLUS Loan must meet the following three requirements to maintain their financial aid 
		eligibility at The University of Tulsa. 
		•  <b>QUALITATIVE</b>: Students are required to maintain a minimum cumulative grade 
		point average. 
		•  <b>QUANTITATIVE</b>: Students are required to complete (pass) a minimum of 67% 
		of hours attempted. 
		•  <b>MAXIMUM TIME FRAME</b>: Students must complete their degree in a timely 
		manner. 
		Satisfactory academic progress is reviewed at the end of each semester once grades have 
		been posted to the academic transcript. Failure to meet each of these minimum 
		academic standards will result in the loss of federal financial aid eligibility. Students are 
		expected to know when they may be placed on Financial Aid Warning, Financial Aid 
		Suspension or Financial Aid Probation based on the complete Satisfactory Academic 
		Progress Policy that may be found on The University of Tulsa Financial Aid 
		website

			<b>Qualitative Grade Point Average.</b> Undergraduate and law students are required to 
		maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00 on all hours attempted 
		from all institutions to remain eligible for federal financial aid. Graduate students are 
		required to maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.00 on all hours 
		attempted from all institutions. 
		
			<b>Quantitative (Pace) Satisfactory Completion of Semester Hours.</b> Undergraduate, 
		graduate, and law students are required to complete (pass) a minimum of 67% of all 
		hours attempted to remain eligible for federal financial aid. Pace is calculated as the total 
		number of credit hours successfully completed divided by the total number of credit 
		hours attempted. Grades of A, B, C, D, F, P, I, MG, and W are all considered attempted 
		hours. All transfer and repeat hours are included in this calculation, as well as all courses 
		dropped within the first three weeks of the semester. 
		
			<b>Maximum Time Frame for Degree Completion.</b> Students must complete their 
		degree within 150% of the published length in credit hours of their degree program to 
		remain eligible for federal financial aid. Hour limits are cumulative; therefore, all 
		accepted hours from all institutions attempted will be included, even if a student did not 
		receive federal student aid. For financial aid purposes, grades of A, B, C, D, F, P, I, MG, 
		and W are all considered attempted hours. All transfer and repeat hours are included in 
		this calculation, as well as all courses dropped within the first three weeks of the 
		semester. The Student Financial Aid office recommends that students contact their 
		academic advisor to ensure they are taking the courses necessary to complete their 
		degree.  
		
			<b>Extension of Eligibility.</b> If extenuating circumstances prevent satisfactory academic 
		progress, a student may request an extension of eligibility by submitting a petition to the 
		Student Financial Services Office. Petitions for federal financial aid reinstatement 
		should be received no later than the first day of class in the semester the extension will 
		take effect. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Repeated Coursework </b>
			</i>
		
		Students may receive federal financial aid consideration to repeat a previously passed 
		course once. Students may repeat failed courses until they have attained a passing grade. 
		An “incomplete” grade (I) that remains on the academic record at the time satisfactory 
		academic progress is reviewed will be treated as not completed, but the attempted hours 
		will be counted. Upon completion of the incomplete (I) course, the grade and course 
		will be given due credit in future consideration. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Special Circumstances  </b>
			</i>
		
		
			<b>Summer Course Work.</b> Summer credits earned either at TU or transferable from 
		another institution into the student’s program may be used to meet the credit hours 
		earned requirement. Grades do not transfer.  
		
			<b>Transfer Students.</b> Students transferring to TU will have credits evaluated and 
		accepted into their program used to position them in the satisfactory academic progress 
		components. Grades do not transfer. 
		
			<b>University of Tulsa Grants/Scholarships.</b> Students receiving financial aid from the 
		resources of The University of Tulsa must maintain a 2.0 cumulative grade point 
		average for grant aid. Students receiving athletic or performance scholarships must meet 
		the eligibility requirements of the respective programs.

			<i>
				<b>FAFSA Verification </b>
			</i>
		
		Students whose FAFSA’s are selected for verification by the federal government must 
		complete a verification worksheet and submit the required federal tax transcripts. 
		Additional documentation may also be required.  
		Effective for the 2013-2014 award year, the federal government implemented changes

		been replaced with customized verification selection criteria that will be published 
		annually by the Department of Education. The Office of Student Financial Services will 
		request the required verification document(s) from the applicant upon receipt of the 
		FAFSA. 
		TU does not disburse awards for students who are selected for verification until the 
		process is complete. Failing to complete verification by the deadlines will result in loss 
		of any eligibility for federal aid funds. If a student completely withdraws prior to 
		submitting the documents for verification, federal aid will not be considered.

			<i>
				<b>Application Procedure  </b>
			</i>
		
		Students must be admitted to the University before final consideration for financial aid 
		is possible. However, applications for admission and financial aid may be submitted and 
		processed simultaneously. Students applying for financial assistance through the Office 
		of Student Financial Services are required to complete the Free Application for Federal 
		Student Aid (FAFSA) online at 
		
			<i>www.fafsa.ed.gov</i>
		
		. Assistance in applying online is available 
		from the Office of Student Financial Services.  
		The FAFSA is used as the University’s application for consideration of most sources 
		of financial assistance. It serves as the student’s financial aid application for the Federal 
		Pell Grant program, TEACH Grant, OTAG program, OTEG (Oklahoma Tuition 
		Equalization Grant), Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG), 
		Federal Perkins Loan, and Federal Work-Study program, as well as documentation of 
		eligibility for any federal loan program. Detailed instructions are included with the 
		FAFSA. An acknowledgement report will be sent when a student’s FAFSA has been 
		processed. 
		Students must reapply annually for financial assistance. After initial application using 
		the FAFSA, students are sent a Renewal Free Application for Federal Student Aid the 
		following year if they meet certain conditions. The Renewal FAFSA is emailed in 
		January to the address listed on the student’s previous FAFSA. It allows students to 
		answer fewer questions if information reported in the previous year is still correct. 
		Either the FAFSA or the Renewal FAFSA may be used to apply for financial assistance.

				<b>TEACH Grant (TEACH)  </b>
			</i>
		
		•  <b>Awards:</b> Up to $4,000 per year for full time enrollment. Effective 2013-2014, 
		Congress passed the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011, which put into place an

		awards made on or after March 2, 2013, must be reduced by 7.1% from the award 
		amount the student would otherwise be eligible to receive. For example, if a 
		student would otherwise be eligible to receive $4,000, the award would be reduced 
		by $284, resulting in an award of $3,716. 
		•  <b>Eligibility:</b> Undergraduate or graduate students enrolled in a post-baccalaureate 
		teacher credential program, or current or prospective teachers. An applicant who is 
		enrolled as an undergraduate student may qualify if he or she has a 3.25 grade point 
		average. If the student is in their first year of college, the grade point average 
		standard applies to the student's cumulative high school record. Alternatively, an 
		applicant qualifies if he or she scores above the 75th percentile on at least one of 
		the batteries in an undergraduate, post-baccalaureate or graduate school admissions 
		test. The student must be completing the coursework or requirements necessary to 
		begin a career in teaching. To receive a TEACH Grant, a teacher candidate must

			<i>
				<b>Direct Stafford Loan: Subsidized and Unsubsidized  </b>
			</i>
		
		•  <b>Awards: </b>Loan amounts may not exceed reasonable college costs, less other 
		scholarship, loan, and gift assistance. Expected family contribution is also used in 
		determining eligibility for the subsidized Stafford Loan. Annual maximum for a 
		dependent undergraduate (subsidized and/or unsubsidized) Stafford Loan is $5,500 
		(maximum $3,500 subsidized) for freshmen, $6,500 (maximum $4,500 subsidized) 
		for sophomores and $7,500 (maximum $5,500 subsidized) for juniors and seniors. 
		Independent undergraduates may borrow up to $9,500 ($3,500 maximum 
		subsidized) as a freshmen, $10,500 as a sophomore (maximum $4,500 subsidized) 
		and $12,500 (maximum $5,500 subsidized) as a junior and senior. The total Direct 
		Stafford Loan debt a student may have outstanding as a dependent undergraduate

			<i/>for procedures for applying for Stafford Loans. 
		•  <b>Interest and Repayment:</b> The federal government pays the interest on a 
		subsidized Stafford loan while the student is in school or in deferment. Borrowers 
		are responsible for the interest during in-school and deferment periods on an 
		unsubsidized Stafford loan. Interest may accumulate until the deferment ends, but 
		the interest will be added to the principal. The current interest rate for 
		undergraduate Stafford loans is 6.8%. The entire loan must be repaid within 10 
		years after repayment begins. If the borrower’s first Stafford loan was disbursed on 
		or after July 1, 1993, the borrower has the option of repaying the loan using a 
		standard, graduated or income-sensitive repayment plan. As a result of the 
		automatic federal budget cuts, known as the “sequester,” additional funding 
		reductions will take affect for all Direct Loans. The sequester increases the 
		origination fees paid by borrowers for Direct Loans where the first disbursement is 
		made on or after December 1, 2013. This includes loans that will be made for the 
		remainder of 2013-14 and summer 2014.  For Direct Subsidized or Unsubsidized 
		loans, the loan fee will increase from 1.051 percent of the principal amount of a 
		loan to 1.072 percent.

		 for more information. TU receives funding from 
		various sources including private foundations, industry, and federal and state agencies.  
		As a federally funded research institution, TU must comply with federal regulations 
		regarding the conduct of research. For example, any research project involving human 
		subjects must be submitted to ORSP for approval by the Institutional Review Board 
		(IRB). When animals are to be used in research, prior approval must be obtained from 
		the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). A listing of many of these

				<b>Graduate Programs </b>
			</i>
		
		Through its Graduate School, The University of Tulsa offers over 35 master’s and 
		doctoral programs in a variety of disciplines in the arts, humanities, business, sciences, 
		and engineering, and cooperates with the College of Law in offering several joint 
		J.D./master’s degrees. Combined bachelor’s/master’s degree programs are available in 
		select academic programs. These combined degree programs offer undergraduates the 
		opportunity to begin taking graduate courses while finishing an undergraduate degree 
		and completing a master’s degree in as little as one year of study beyond the bachelor’s 
		degree. The University’s graduate programs, which enroll more than 800 students, are 
		described in the <i>Graduate Bulletin</i>.  
		Although graduate work is not offered in every discipline, graduate education at The 
		University of Tulsa strengthens the undergraduate mission in several ways. It enables 
		the University to recruit and retain faculty with distinguished records of scholarship. All 
		members of the graduate faculty teach undergraduates and participate in undergraduate 
		curriculum design. Graduate assistants help provide a research environment that allows 
		the faculty to go forward with their scholarship and often to include undergraduates in 
		selected research projects. Graduate teaching assistants enable the University to offer 
		many small, high quality courses across campus. Graduate assistants in the Writing 
		Center, the Mathematics Lab, and other areas provide undergraduates with 
		individualized tutorial assistance. Finally, the presence of graduate programs compels 
		greater breadth and depth of the library resources, computer facilities, and scientific 
		instrumentation used by undergraduates.

				<b>Religious Life  </b>
			</i>
		
		Because The University of Tulsa was founded as an institution of higher education of 
		the Presbyterian Church (USA), the University encourages a full, rich, and diverse 
		expression of religious life. The Office of the Sharp Chaplain provides for and supports 
		the expression of the life of faith on campus: planning, implementing, and sponsoring 
		religiously oriented programs; providing counseling and pastoral care; serving as a 
		liaison with other religious groups; and assisting the campus community in nurturing a 
		caring and respectful environment for its pervasive expressions of faith.  
		Sharp Memorial Chapel, home to the ministries of the Sharp Chaplain, shares the 
		plaza with McFarlin Library, Kendall Hall, and Tyrrell Hall. Its location at the center 
		and heart of the campus is a fitting metaphor for the University’s historic and 
		continuing covenantal ties with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). With renovations 
		completed in April 2004, the chapel sanctuary has been refurbished and a new wing 
		now stands in place of the original west wing of the chapel complex. On the first floor 
		of the new wing is the Robert C. Sharp Westminster Student Center for Presbyterian 
		campus ministry; the Josephine P. Sharp Reception Suite for formal receptions and 
		other special events; the Buford Atrium for group meetings, presentations, lunch and 
		dinner gatherings; and a full kitchen. On the new wing’s second floor is the Martha S. 
		Buford Canterbury Suite — a seminar room for group meetings, seminars and 
		workshops — and the Offices of the Sharp Chaplain. The Chapel complex also offers, 
		beyond its other striking architectural features, a new bell tower and carillons. A number 
		of campus ministries provide programs of outreach and nurture for their respective 
		constituencies at the University. Each of these ministries, which are listed on page 69, 
		adds its distinctive identity and voice to the University’s rich and vibrant religious life.

		The University of Tulsa 
			
  
			
  
		The University of Tulsa maintains a statement of rights, freedoms, and responsibilities, 
		which sets forth general guidelines suggested for members of the University 
		community. 
		The document outlines University policy in the following areas: freedom of academic 
		inquiry, freedom of expression, freedom of association, right to privacy, off-campus 
		freedom, student self-government, right of students to participate in University 
		government and the decision-making process, and standards in disciplinary proceedings. 
		More detailed information concerning any of these areas may be obtained from the 
		Office of Student Affairs, Holmes Student Center, and the current <i>Student Handbook</i>

				<b>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)  </b>
			</i>
		
		The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR 
		Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law 
		applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. 
		Department of Education. 
		FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. 
		These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a 
		school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are 
		&#34;eligible students.&#34; 
		Eligible students have the right to inspect and review their education records 
		maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide copies of records unless, 
		for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for eligible students to review the

		Eligible students have the right to request that a school correct records which they

		In keeping with the ideals and standards of higher education and the mission of The 
		University of Tulsa, students are expected to treat one another and other members of 
		the University community with mutual respect, dignity, honor, and trust.  
		Specifically, students are expected to respect order, fairness, morality, and the rights 
		of others; obey the laws of the land and the regulations, rules, and policies of the 
		University; and conduct their activities with high regard for the ideals of higher 
		education, which include personal honor, academic honesty, and intellectual freedom.  
		Behavior that runs contrary to these expectations provides sufficient cause for the 
		University to initiate disciplinary proceedings, as specified in the current <i>Student </i>

		The Henry Kendall College of Arts and Sciences offers students the opportunity to gain 
		a broadly-based liberal arts education, to learn to think critically, and to master the skills 
		of writing clearly, logically, and persuasively. In addition to their major fields, all 
		students in the Henry Kendall College of Arts and Sciences study a variety of areas of 
		knowledge, including the humanities, the arts, the social sciences, and the natural 
		sciences. In the process, they study Western and other cultures and acquire competence 
		in mathematics.  
		Courses in the general curriculum are taught by experienced faculty members in 
		classes small enough to facilitate interaction between faculty and students. Students also 
		select a major and minor field of study from among the traditional academic disciplines 
		and have available to them some unusual and challenging interdisciplinary programs 
		such as majors in arts management, Chinese studies, environmental policy, film studies, 
		organizational studies, and women’s and gender studies, as well as minors in early 
		childhood intervention and creative writing. Students may also design a specialized 
		major program of concentration and may earn certificates in interdisciplinary certificate 
		programs. Perhaps of greatest importance, students in the Henry Kendall College of 
		Arts and Sciences work with many distinguished teachers and scholars who are 
		committed to rigorous, high-quality undergraduate education. In short, students are 
		offered an education that allows them to expand their perspectives, explore new areas 
		of knowledge, engage in concentrated and extensive study of specific areas of 
		knowledge, master the skills necessary to function in the modern world, and become 
		part of a community of teachers, scholars, and learners.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Our Mission </b>
			</i>
		
		The College nourishes free and rigorous intellectual inquiry among students and faculty 
		in an atmosphere that respects differences in background, belief, and aspiration; it also 
		maintains and strengthens the academic and civic values that underlie and support an 
		open, culturally diverse, and democratic society. 
		We seek to create, refine, conserve, and disseminate knowledge and artistic expression 
		at the highest levels. The success of the College in offering all students of The 
		University of Tulsa a broadly based liberal arts education depends upon the rigor with 
		which the faculty approaches teaching and scholarship and upon the degree to which 
		students commit to intellectual excellence, aesthetic appreciation, and critical thinking. 
		The faculty affirms that service to the institution, the profession, and the community 
		is a significant dimension of the professional life of faculty members. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Accreditation </b>
			</i>
		
		All programs for the preparation of teachers are recognized by the Oklahoma 
		Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability (OCEQA) and nationally 
		accredited by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council. The School of Music of 
		The University of Tulsa is an accredited institutional member of the National 
		Association of Schools of Music (NASM). The following degrees are listed by NASM: 
		Bachelor of Arts in Music, Bachelor of Music Education, Bachelor of Music in 
		Performance, and Bachelor of Music in Composition. The deaf education program is

		speech-language pathology is accredited by the Council on Academic Accreditation in 
		Audiology and Speech Language Pathology (CAA) of the American Speech-Language-
		Hearing Association (ASHA). The Ph.D. program in clinical psychology is accredited by 
		the American Psychological Association.  
		
			<b>Academic Programs  </b>
		
		
			<i>
				<b>The Core Curriculum  </b>
			</i>
		
		In the core curriculum, there are two fundamental requirements. The first is that each 
		student learn to write English with precision and fluency, a process enhanced by 
		continuing practice in courses across the curriculum. The second requirement is that in 
		completing a bachelor’s degree each student acquire broad skills and knowledge 
		complementary to his or her academic specialization.  
		To earn the Bachelor of Arts degree, the student completes study of a second 
		language through the fourth-semester level or demonstrates equivalent proficiency. 
		Language study is available in Chinese, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, 
		Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and American Sign Language. Students who enroll in a 
		language course above 1004 and complete the course with a grade of C or higher 
		receive “delayed proficiency credit” for the previous course as well. Students with 
		previous college credit or AP/IB credit are not eligible for delayed proficiency credit in 
		the same language. A maximum of either three or four delayed credits may be earned. 
		Non-native English speakers should consult the College Office of Advising for 
		Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. 
		The Bachelor of Science degree requires the student to complete a sequence of 
		prescribed courses in mathematics and statistics. Selection of course work may be 
		stipulated by the major program. The Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Music, and 
		Bachelor of Music Education are pre-professional degrees based on the College’s 
		historic involvement with the fine and performing arts. Degree requirements in these 
		programs vary.  
		Each incoming student completes a sequence of writing courses that provides him or 
		her with the skills needed to meet the expectations and demands of college-level 
		assignments. The writing course teaches practical skills and abilities that are broadly 
		applicable. An advanced course is available for highly qualified students. A fully-staffed 
		writing laboratory is also available to all students who desire to work one-on-one with 
		trained tutors. This laboratory is equipped with personal computers that are compatible 
		with the large number of microcomputers available in the Computer Resource Center.  
		As part of the writing requirement, each incoming student completes a specialized 
		course called a First Seminar (FS 1973) during the first year at The University of Tulsa. 
		The First Seminar provides an intimate atmosphere in which to study with a faculty 
		member and underscores the enduring relationship between writing and learning by 
		requiring several papers to be written during the semester.  
		All incoming undergraduates must also complete, place out of, or show proficiency in 
		Contemporary Mathematics (MATH 1083) or another basic mathematics course 
		certified by the University Curriculum Committee, such as Basic Calculus (MATH 
		1103), Mathematics with Applications (MATH 1093), or Pre-calculus Mathematics 
		(MATH 1163). Incoming freshmen also complete AS 1001, an orientation course that 
	</page>
	<page number="87" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
		The Henry Kendall College of Arts and Sciences 
		77 
			
  
		introduces students to a disciplinary topic as well as skills and services necessary to 
		student success. This course is taught by the student’s faculty advisor.  
		Undergraduates in the Henry Kendall College of Arts and Sciences complete their 
		course of study with an intensive, rigorous, senior-year academic experience. The nature 
		of this senior requirement varies by discipline but usually consists of a specially designed 
		course in the student’s major area of study. To determine the appropriate senior 
		requirement, students should consult their faculty advisor or the College Office of 
		Advising.  
		
			<i>
				<b>The General Curriculum  </b>
			</i>
		
		The general curriculum encourages the acquisition of knowledge that spans the arts and 
		sciences. Courses in the general curriculum are distributed among intellectual categories 
		to guarantee that each student has an understanding and an appreciation of several 
		kinds of knowledge in addition to the knowledge acquired in the major and minor. 
		Courses in the general curriculum also are designed to give students an introduction to 
		the methodologies and perspectives of a variety of disciplines. Students choose from 
		courses offered in the following categories: Aesthetic Inquiry and Creative Experience 
		(Block I), Historical and Social Interpretation (Block II), and Scientific Investigation 
		(Block III). The general curriculum requirements include the completion of two courses 
		taken in Block I, four in Block II, and two in Block III. For a description of each block, 
		see page 20. 
		All students in the Henry Kendall College of Arts and Sciences must also meet a 
		Cultural Diversity and Gender Studies Requirement by taking two courses from a list 
		compiled by the College Curriculum Committee. These are courses that focus on the 
		formation and diversity of cultural and gender identities as well as on the way these 
		identities change and interact with one another. These courses may also be used to 
		satisfy requirements in the core curriculum, the general curriculum, or the area of 
		concentration. Course selection in core and general curricula may in some cases by 
		dictated by the major. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Area of Concentration  </b>
			</i>
		
		The area of concentration includes a major subject and a minor field or certificate 
		program chosen by the student with the approval of the major advisor. For the 
		Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, at least 39 but no more than 55 
		semester hours shall be earned in the area of concentration. The 55-hour total may be 
		exceeded only by completing hours beyond the 124 required for graduation. At least 27 
		but no more than 39 semester hours shall be earned in the major subject. The 39-hour 
		total may be exceeded only by completing hours beyond the 124 required for 
		graduation. For the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, at least 51 but no more than 65 
		semester hours shall be earned in the area of concentration. The 65-hour total may be 
		exceeded only by completing hours beyond the 124 required for graduation. At least 27 
		but no more than 53 semester hours shall be earned in the major subject. The 53-hour 
		total may be exceeded only by completing hours beyond the 124 required for 
		graduation. To be eligible for graduation, the student must achieve a grade point average 
		of at least 2.2 in the area of concentration as well as an overall grade point average of 
		least 2.0 and the completion of a total of 124 hours. 
		Admission to certain degree programs may be limited and have additional academic 
		requirements or a separate program application.

			<i>
				<b>The Major Subject  </b>
			</i>
		
		Students usually choose their major subject between the end of their first year and end 
		of their second year of study. Two-thirds of the course work in the major subject must 
		be at the 3000 or 4000 level. Each department determines the exact number of hours 
		required in the major subject and the area of concentration. Along with majors in all of 
		the departments, the College offers seven interdisciplinary majors: arts management, 
		Chinese studies, environmental policy, film studies, organizational studies, Russian 
		studies, and women’s and gender studies.  
		
			<i>
				<b>The Minor Field  </b>
			</i>
		
		The minor field comprises courses from one or more disciplines that are distinct from 
		the major. The minor field consists of at least 12 semester hours, six of which must be 
		at the 3000 or 4000 level, in a subject approved by the major advisor. For a minor in 
		languages, all 12 hours must be at the 3000-4000 level. The number of hours in the 
		minor may exceed 12 as long as the total number of hours in the area of concentration 
		(all courses in the major subject area and the minor field) does not exceed the total 
		permitted. The student and the major advisor should consult the department in which 
		the minor is awarded in order to determine the appropriate courses. The College 
		Curriculum Committee must approve any programs that differ from these College 
		guidelines. Interdisciplinary minors in early childhood intervention, creative writing, 
		Russian studies, and women’s and gender studies have been approved by the College 
		Curriculum Committee and do not need to be approved on a case-by-case basis.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Student-Designed Area of Concentration  </b>
			</i>
		
		The student-designed area of concentration provides a means of accommodating 
		student needs and interests where no appropriate program exists in the College. It is 
		also intended to accommodate student interests that may cross collegiate lines.  
		A request by a student for a student-designed area of concentration must be 
		approved by the College Curriculum Committee. To be eligible to submit a proposal, 
		the student must have a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0 and must have 
		completed between 30 and 75 hours of acceptable course work. The Office of the Dean 
		will provide assistance to any student regarding preparation of the proposal. 
		It is mandatory that the student secure the assistance of one or more faculty members 
		whose areas of competence are associated with the student’s interest. All policies 
		governing the area of concentration are applicable to a student-designed area of 
		concentration. No more than two independent study courses may be substituted in a 
		previously approved area of concentration. If such substitutions are necessary, the 
		program must be re-evaluated by the College Curriculum Committee.  
		A proposal requesting permission to pursue a student-designed area of concentration 
		must include the following: (1) a statement of the aims the student seeks to realize 
		through the program; (2) a statement demonstrating that the existing programs of the 
		College do not offer opportunities to achieve these aims; (3) an itemized list of the 
		courses the student will seek to include in the program; and (4) an endorsement of the 
		student’s plan from the faculty member or members who will serve as the student’s 
		major advisor(s) in the program.

				<b>Certificate Programs  </b>
			</i>
		
		Students in the Henry Kendall College of Arts and Sciences may substitute an 
		interdisciplinary certificate program for a minor field. Certificates are granted in 
		advertising, African American studies, classics, creative writing, international studies, 
		journalism studies, Judaic studies, museum studies, political philosophy, and visual 
		studies. Certificate programs consist of between 18 and 24 credits. If the certificate is 
		being completed in addition to the area of concentration (major and minor), credits may 
		be used to fulfill requirements for both the degree and the certificate. If the certificate is 
		being completed in lieu of a minor, at least 12 hours must solely fulfill requirements for

		The official statement of the American Association of Law Schools emphasizes that law 
		schools prefer students who are well-rounded in their educational backgrounds, capable 
		of critical, creative thinking, and able to express themselves. No specific undergraduate 
		major is recommended or required. Thus, undergraduates with an interest in pursuing 
		the legal profession usually major in an area of breadth rather than one of specialization, 
		make full use of their electives, and concentrate on courses that emphasize analytical 
		ability and facility with the English language. The University of Tulsa maintains an

		consult the College Office of Advising.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Honors Program  </b>
			</i>
		
		Graduating high school seniors with exceptional academic records and a spirit of 
		intellectual curiosity may apply for admission as freshmen to the University’s Honors 
		Program. Each student in the Honors Program completes a core of courses, listed on 
		page 84. The courses in the Honors Program core are credited to the student’s general 
		curriculum and elective requirements. Honors Program students may choose to major 
		in any academic discipline offered by The University of Tulsa. The Honors Program 
		courses are taken in sequence, rely on primary sources, and promote dialogue with the 
		architects of the modern worldview. Students admitted to the Honors Program receive 
		an academic scholarship. More information about the Honors Program may be found 
		on page 21 of this <i>Bulletin</i> or at <i>www.utulsa.edu/academics/Honors-Program.aspx</i>.

			<i>
				<b>Public Service Internships  </b>
			</i>
		
		Qualified undergraduate students in any major may participate in the Henry Kendall 
		College Public Service Internship Program, which is designed to help students explore 
		their interests, obtain practical experience, and prepare for public life. Students intern 
		with governmental agencies, non-profit organizations, health care services, and various 
		arts organizations throughout the city of Tulsa. Public service internships carry three 
		hours of academic credit, and are unpaid. Additional information, including 
		descriptions, evaluations, and applications, is available from the Office of Student 
		Affairs.  
		
			<b>Seminars, Independent Research, and Independent Readings  </b>
		
		Each department in the College may offer seminars and independent readings at any 
		level for varying amounts of credit. Seminars vary in content and structure according to 
		the design of the instructors. Students who wish to undertake independent research or 
		readings must secure the consent of an instructor to supervise the study. The instructor 
		has the option to accept or reject the projected study. Faculties vary in their policies 
		regarding an instructor’s availability for supervising independent work. 
		
			<b>Academic Policies </b>
		
		
			<i>
				<b>Advising  </b>
			</i>
		
		Each student is assigned a first-year faculty advisor upon enrolling in the College and 
		coordinates his or her schedule with that advisor until declaring a major. Once accepted 
		by a department, the student is assigned an advisor by the department chair. Students

		are encouraged to return to the Office of Advising at least once during their junior year 
		and again prior to the second semester of their senior year for a graduation check to 
		ensure the timely completion of all degree requirements. Students may inquire at the 
		Office of Advising at any time with regard to specific needs or issues. The Office of 
		Advising maintains student records, and its professional staff coordinates advising 
		activities within the College.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Advanced Standing  </b>
			</i>
		
		Work completed at other institutions is evaluated by the Office of Advising. Once 
		students have completed 62 hours, no additional work from a junior or community 
		college may be applied toward graduation requirements. The last 45 hours of course 
		work must be completed in residence at The University of Tulsa.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and OSSM  </b>
			</i>
		
		Students may earn proficiency or exemption for courses in any degree program by 
		successfully completing a faculty-administered examination.  
		A list of courses credited for Advanced Placement Examinations is available from the 
		Office of the Registrar. The Henry Kendall College of Arts and Sciences will award at 
		least 30 credits to students in the College who complete the IB Diploma with a score of 
		28 or above. Some credit may also be available for students completing the IB Diploma 
		with a score below 28. The College will also extend college credit for some High Level 
		examinations and some Standard Level examinations. The amount and kind of credit 
		will be determined by individual departments. The Henry Kendall College of Arts and 
		Sciences awards credit for some mathematics and science courses completed with high 
		scores at the Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics. Students should consult 
		the College Office of Advising for details.  
		No more than 36 hours of credit may apply through testing (International 
		Baccalaureate, OSSM, Advanced Placement, or proficiency).  
		Credit by CLEP examination is not awarded by the Henry Kendall College of Arts 
		and Sciences.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Electives  </b>
			</i>
		
		Beyond meeting core curriculum, general curriculum, and area of concentration 
		requirements, students must complete enough hours in electives to equal at least 124 
		hours.  
		• 
		Students with extensive experience in a language other than English must 
		consult the Department of Languages before enrolling in a course in that 
		language. Consult the College Office of Advising office staff for additional 
		information.  
		• 
		No more than one First Seminar may count toward graduation requirements.  
		• 
		No electives in the student’s major will count beyond the 39-hour limit.  
		• 
		No electives in the student’s area of concentration will count beyond the 55-
		hour limit.  
		
			<i>
				<b> Pass/D-F Grading Option  </b>
			</i>
		
		A student may take one course per semester on a Pass/D-F basis, provided that the 
		total of Pass/D-F credits for a student does not exceed the 18 Pass/D-F credits that

		may be applied toward the degree. The rule of one course per semester for Pass/D-F 
		credit is applicable even if the course is offered only for Pass/D-F credit. Courses 
		graded only as Pass/D-F also count toward the final allowable total of 18 Pass/D-F 
		credits. With the exception of AS 1001, courses included in the core curriculum, the 
		general curriculum, and in the student’s area of concentration may not be taken under 
		the Pass/D-F option.  
		The decision to take a course on a Pass/D-F basis must be made within the first three 
		weeks of a regular semester or within the first 10 days of a summer session. The student 
		must obtain approval in the Office of Advising to take a course Pass/D-F. Deadlines 
		for declaring this option are published in each course schedule.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Statute of Limitation  </b>
			</i>
		
		The policy applies to students in the Henry Kendall College of Arts and Sciences who 
		have left The University of Tulsa before finishing a degree and who later return to the 
		University without having attended another institution of higher education in the 
		intervening period. Those students are allowed to continue their program of study 
		under the curricular requirements that applied to them at the time they originally 
		entered the Henry Kendall College of Arts and Sciences unless more than five years 
		have passed since the completion of their last semester in the College at the University. 
		In the case of the curricular requirements for the major, the student returning within the 
		five-year limit is allowed to declare and to pursue any major that was available at the 
		time the student entered the College as long as the appropriate courses are offered at 
		the University when the student returns.

		The program in anthropology, offering a Bachelor of Arts degree, is designed to provide 
		students with a strong general background in anthropology preparatory to graduate 
		studies or employment in fields such as qualitative and applied research, archaeology, 
		foreign relations, international business, international law, and social work. The 
		curriculum requires all students, under the supervision of an anthropology faculty 
		member, to complete a research project in some area of the student’s interest. 
		Individual counseling is provided for all students. 
		Lower division work in anthropology emphasizes the four major divisions of the 
		discipline: physical anthropology, archaeology, cultural anthropology, and linguistics. 
		Upper division courses emphasize archaeology and cultural anthropology, with 
		supporting courses in physical anthropology and linguistics offered at the junior level. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Learning Objectives </b>
			</i>
		
		There are three learning objectives for anthropology students. The first is career and 
		academic preparation, enabling students successfully to pursue higher degrees in their 
		chosen specialties. The second learning objective is intensive exposure to human 
		diversity, past and present, physical and cultural. This directly supports the third 
		objective, which is to prepare all students to understand and function in an increasingly 
		interconnected world.

		The mission of the School of Art is to create a stimulating environment for the practice, 
		understanding and advancement of the visual arts. 
		The mission is carried out by: 
		•  Providing students with a thorough understanding of artistic traditions past and 
		present to help them find their place in contemporary artistic practices; 
		•  Encouraging the exploration of innovative artistic techniques and practices in an 
		interdisciplinary environment; and 
		•  Helping students develop sound studio practices by encouraging active 
		involvement in the community. 
		Our strategic priorities are: 
		•  Cultivating students, faculty, staff and administrators who promote the visual arts 
		as central to culture; 
		•  Maintaining a rigorous yet flexible curriculum that stimulates critical thinking and 
		promotes technical expertise; and 
		•  Investing in facilities and technology that support our mission.  
		The program in art offers the Bachelor of Fine Arts and the Bachelor of Arts degrees in 
		art with emphases in the studio areas of ceramics, sculpture, graphic design, painting, 
		photography, digital media, and printmaking, and the Bachelor of Arts degree in the 
		academic area of art history. The curriculum for all degrees allows students to develop 
		critical thinking skills and technical expertise in an interdisciplinary environment. 
		The Bachelor of Fine Arts in art degree enables students to enter professional careers 
		in art and to find their place in contemporary artistic practice. It is the degree most 
		often required for admission to graduate programs offering the Master of Fine Arts 
		degree, which is the most accepted terminal degree in art and the degree required for 
		college-level teaching. 
		The Bachelor of Arts in art degree certifies that the student has completed a major 
		study in the visual arts as an integral part of a general liberal arts degree program. Career 
		preparation is not the primary objective of the Bachelor of Arts degree; however, it 
		ensures that the student has a broad approach to artistic production.

		Teacher certification in art education may be acquired through the Oklahoma State 
		Department of Education by combining the Bachelor of Fine Arts or Bachelor of Arts 
		program with a second major in education.  The requirements for a major in education 
		may be found beginning on page 128 of this <i>Bulletin</i>.  
		The Bachelor of Arts in art history offers the student general knowledge about art 
		through the ages and the critical skills to interpret it. This degree prepares the student 
		for entry-level careers in museums, galleries, and arts organizations, in art publishing, 
		and for admission to graduate programs in art history, art conservation and museum 
		studies. The degree also equips students with the critical reading and thinking, visual 
		analysis, and writing skills to pursue a wide range of other careers. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Admission </b>
			</i>
		
		There is no portfolio admission for students who enter the University at the freshman 
		level and wish to pursue the Bachelor of Fine Arts and Bachelor in Arts in art degrees. 
		All transfer students to the studio art program must submit a portfolio of work for 
		review by the faculty member in the area of emphasis, and acceptance is based on that 
		portfolio review. 
		
			<i>
				<b>General Requirements </b>
			</i>
		
		Students pursuing the Bachelor of Fine Arts or Bachelor of Arts in art complete the 
		four core course requirements before taking intermediary and upper division courses. In 
		the core courses, students learn basic skills about art-making and develop sound studio 
		practices. The courses form the foundation that will support students as they work 
		towards designing a curriculum in their areas of emphasis. 
		Students pursuing the Bachelor of Arts in art history complete the two introductory 
		courses before choosing from a broad range of upper division courses. Students are 
		encouraged to study abroad and to pursue internships in their areas of study. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Learning Objectives </b>
			</i>
		
		
			<b>Program Objective 1. </b>Students who complete the undergraduate program will 
		demonstrate competency in the practice of discipline-based studio areas. 
		a.  Develop the expressive aspects of art (realizing creative ideas in visual form and 
		developing a body of work illustrating those creative ideas).  
		b.  Develop the conceptual aspects of art (producing quality work that exhibits 
		original concepts and is consistent with those concepts).  
		c.  Develop the formal and technical aspects of art (illustrating a mastery of materials 
		and tools, and having a grasp of how to use and manipulate formal elements and 
		composition for an intended effect). 
		
			<b>Program Objective 2.</b> Students who complete the undergraduate program will engage 
		in art critical and art historical thinking and writing.

		management. Students are also required to complete an arts management internship as a 
		capstone experience to practically apply the concepts and techniques learned in the 
		classroom. Semester internships may be completed locally, regionally, nationally, and/or 
		internationally through special arrangements.

		The communication program’s strong liberal arts orientation equips students for a 
		variety of professional opportunities in communication as well as graduate study in 
		communication, law, business administration, and other areas. With appropriately 
		chosen electives, students can prepare themselves for careers in media studies, public 
		relations, advertising, journalism, visual studies, and related fields. 
		Students pursuing a major in communication typically choose the B.A. degree. 
		Communication majors who wish to choose the B.S. degree must petition the faculty 
		chair for permission.  
		The three core courses in the major provide a strong background in communication, 
		covering topics ranging from symbolic processes and systems to theories and 
		philosophy of communication research. Majors also choose three of the four 
		foundation courses that emphasize the larger social consequences of communication. 
		Working with their advisors, communication majors develop an 18-hour emphasis in a 
		particular area of the discipline. Communication majors may, with the approval of their 
		advisor, develop their own individualized emphasis in communication. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Learning Objectives </b>
			</i>
		
		Students who complete the undergraduate program in communication are expected to 
		be able to: 
		•  Evaluate and critique the central theoretical concepts in the study of 
		communication; 
		•  Use and understand basic social science methodologies;  
		•  Effectively use writing to convey their ideas;  
		•  Demonstrate a basic competence in oral communication;  
		•  Critically engage with the world of visual and digital communication; and  
		•  Fully realize both their rights and their responsibilities as citizens within a modern 
		world.

		The faculty of the Department of Communication Disorders offer curricula leading to 
		the Bachelor of Arts in Deaf Education (B.A.D.E.) and the Bachelor of Science in 
		Speech-language Pathology (B.S.S.P.). The mission of the Department of 
		Communication Disorders is to provide challenging academic coursework, clinical 
		experiences, and research opportunities for students pursuing professional careers in 
		speech-language pathology and deaf education.  
		These programs combine a broad liberal arts undergraduate curriculum with strong 
		academic coursework and practicum opportunities as a background for the management 
		of communication disorders. The deaf education program focuses on preparing teachers 
		of deaf and hard of hearing students. The program in speech-language pathology 
		prepares students for graduate study since the master’s degree is the entry level into the 
		profession. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Certification </b>
			</i>
		
		The programs in speech-language pathology and deaf education are recognized by the 
		Oklahoma Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability and are fully 
		accredited by the State of Oklahoma. The speech-language pathology program prepares 
		students for certification by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association 
		(ASHA) upon completion of the master’s degree. The degree program in deaf education 
		leads to state teacher certification by the State of Oklahoma and national certification by 
		the Council on Education of the Deaf (CED) and Teacher Education Accreditation 
		Council (TEAC). 
		
			<i>
				<b>Admission/Retention Requirements </b>
			</i>
		
		Students qualifying for admission to the University may enter either of these programs. 
		Retention requires majors to earn a grade of at least C in all program courses taken. 
		Courses may be repeated, if necessary, to meet this requirement. Students with a grade 
		point average lower than 3.0 in speech-language pathology courses will enroll in clinical 
		practicum if recommended by faculty. Failure to pass the practicum course will result in 
		non-recommendation for graduate study in speech-language pathology study. 
		Admission to the master’s program in speech-language pathology at The University of 
		Tulsa is not guaranteed to undergraduate majors.

				<b>The Tulsa Curriculum </b>
			</i>
		
		The Tulsa Curriculum is designed to help students understand and appreciate several 
		areas of knowledge in addition to a specialty. To meet specific certification 
		requirements, speech-language pathology majors take PSY 3063 and/or EDUC 3713 
		and ANTH 2023 (Block II). Students receiving the Bachelor of Science in Speech-
		language Pathology (B.S.S.P.) must also take a First Seminar and complete a formal 
		writing course (ENGL 1033), a mathematics course (MATH 1083 or 1093), a basic 
		course in statistics (PSY 2023, SOC 2023, or STAT 2013), one course in a biological 
		science, and one course in a physical science. Speech-language pathology students must 
		also take the Senior Seminar class offered by the department. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Deaf Education </b>
			</i>
		
		The deaf education program prepares teachers of students who are deaf or hard-of-
		hearing (HH), leading to N-12 certification from the Oklahoma Commission for 
		Educational Quality and Accountability in the area of Deaf/HH. The program is 
		accredited by the Council on Education of the Deaf (CED) as a comprehensive 
		program. Therefore, students take courses in American Sign Language as well as courses 
		focusing on auditory-oral approaches. In addition to the deaf education course 
		sequence, students apply for admission to the Teacher Education Program and take 
		methods courses provided by the School of Urban Education.

		The Department of Educational Studies seeks to advance theory, research, and 
		scholarship in the field of education. The faculty accomplishes this through individual 
		and collaborative research and writing projects, and through aiding students to think 
		critically about education. We conceive of education broadly; faculty and students focus 
		on questions including (but not limited to) the aims and purposes of education and the 
		nature of learners and learning institutions and contexts. The approach of the 
		department is multi-disciplinary and involves scholarship in fields such as philosophy, 
		psychology, anthropology, sociology, history, and political science. In addition, we are 
		linked with the larger educational community, locally and internationally, in service of 
		practice and policy.

		“Urban Education” is representative of the <i>best</i> educational research and applied 
		practices available in the field today. Issues of race, gender, socio-economic class, equity, 
		linguistic pluralism, and social justice can be found in every classroom whether urban, 
		suburban, rural, public or private. The <i>degree</i> to which these factors can be found in a 
		school is the only difference.  
		The mission of the School of Urban Education is to develop transformative 
		professional educators who are: 
		•  Subject matter experts; 
		•  Practicing scholars of educational research; 
		•  Ethical, dedicated representatives of the profession; and 
		•  Equipped to advance every child’s learning amid the social, economic and cultural 
		diversity found in the classroom and surrounding community. 
		Cultural philosopher and educator Henry Giroux (1943- ) defines a “transformative 
		educator” as one who “has a social vision and commitment to make public schools 
		democratic public spheres, where all children, regardless of race, class, gender and age 
		can learn what it means to be able to participate fully in a society that affirms and 
		sustains the principles of equality, freedom, and social justice and who has the courage 
		to take risks, to look into the future and to imagine a world that could be, as opposed to 
		simply what is.”<i/>
		
		To achieve the goal of developing transformative professional educators, there will be 
		early and extensive clinical opportunities for the student intern to be active in a 
		partnership with a specific school. Research indicates that, just as with the medical 
		profession, the more hours spent in the clinical experience to apply content knowledge 
		and practices, the better prepared the intern will be for transition to career 
		responsibilities. 
		Learning to integrate technology into classrooms is a fundamental component of the 
		teacher preparation program. In addition to standard uses of technology tools, there will 
		be the opportunity to understand and assist the progress of students in a classroom 
		through software analysis, applications of various social media and interpretation and 
		uses of data to advance learning.  
		All education courses taken by student teaching interns will stress the relevance of the 
		course content to classroom applications as demonstrated by on-site projects with 
		partner schools whenever possible.

		The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree is offered by the faculty of the Department of 
		English. The aim of the undergraduate major in English is to educate students in 
		literature and language and in the practice of writing, and to enhance their 
		understanding of the tradition of liberal arts. The major develops the ability to 
		understand and appreciate literature in its historical and cultural contexts, to read closely 
		and analytically in a broad range of texts, and to write about language and literature with 
		clarity and precision.  
		The English core emphasizes basic experiences of the literary tradition in England 
		and America and introduces students to critical methods and theoretical approaches to 
		literary study. On this foundation, English electives focus on literary periods, major 
		literary figures, the several genres of literature, and the nature and history of the English 
		language. Work in related areas such as foreign languages, philosophy, history, film 
		studies, and creative writing is encouraged. The overall aim of the program is flexible, 
		yet directive and cumulative, and provides broad opportunities for professional as well 
		as personal post-graduate application. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Learning Objectives:  </b>
			</i>
		
		•  To facilitate student learning by providing knowledge, resources, and challenges for 
		their growth; 
		•  To expose students to unfamiliar literary works (including film, digital media, and 
		other narrative and poetic forms), as well as to canonical or traditional texts; 
		•  To improve student reading, writing, and thinking through careful practice with 
		frequent and substantial feedback from faculty; 
		•  To cultivate in students a strong sense of curiosity and desire to learn; and 
		•  To serve and reach the community through our graduates, programs, events, and 
		continuing education.

				<b>Major Subject </b>
			</i>
		
		The English major requires a minimum of 30 hours in English course work, 9 hours in 
		the English core, and 21 in English electives. The maximum number of hours in the 
		major is 39. 
		Courses in the major are distributed as follows: 
		English Core: 2000-level (9 hours) 
		ENGL 2313, Reading Major American Writers .................................................................. 3 
		ENGL 2513, Reading Major British Writers I ..................................................................... 3 
		ENGL 2523, Reading Major British Writers II ................................................................... 3 
		English Electives: 3000/4000 level (21 hours) 
		One 3000/4000-level course in a literary period after 1800 .............................................. 3 
		Two 3000/4000-level courses in a literary period before 1800 ......................................... 6 
		Four elective courses, may include 6 hours of creative writing and/or  
		  film studies ........................................................................................................................... 12 
		
			<b>Total Hours ........................................................................................................... 30 </b>
		
		Majors are required to include in their elective programs at least one 4000-level course 
		in addition to the Senior Project in English. It may be used to satisfy the distribution 
		requirement set forth above. Enrollment in 4000-level courses requires the relevant 
		prerequisite from the English core or permission of the instructor. For reasons of 
		continuity of study, and to assure that prerequisites have been met, majors are advised 
		to begin their work in the English core and to complete at least six of the required nine 
		hours before enrolling in English electives. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Teaching Certification </b>
			</i>
		
		Students seeking secondary teacher certification in English complete a second major in 
		education in addition to the major in English. See the School of Urban Education 
		beginning on page 128 of this <i>Bulletin</i> for requirements. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Minor Field for English Majors </b>
			</i>
		
		In consultation with the English advisor, students choose at least 12 hours of course 
		work in a subject demonstrably related to English. At least six hours in the minor field 
		must be at the 3000 or 4000 level. 
		
			<i>
				<b>TURC Tutorial </b>

		The environmental policy major is an interdisciplinary program in environmental 
		studies. It rests on the premise that students must be able to combine an understanding 
		of the scientific basis for environmental problems with knowledge of human needs, 
		history, politics, and economics to derive practical solutions to environmental issues. 
		Correspondingly, course work involves classes with environmental scholars in various 
		natural science, social science, and humanities departments. While providing a rigorous 
		and broad educational experience, the major also allows students to custom design an 
		area of strength using elective course work.  
		Students are encouraged to use an internship or study abroad as a capstone 
		experience for the major. Both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees are 
		offered. In addition to the differences in core requirements, note the differences in 
		MATH and STAT requirements below. 
		Students majoring in environmental policy should carefully note the prerequisites 
		listed below and plan the use of their elective courses accordingly. Planning in 
		conjunction with the program advisors is highly recommended. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Course Requirements </b>
			</i>
		
		The Bachelor of Arts in environmental policy requires a minimum of 35 hours in the 
		major, while the Bachelor of Science in environmental policy requires a minimum of 38 
		hours in the major. In both cases, at least two-thirds of the hours must be at the 3000 or 
		4000 level.

		The history major exposes students to a range of historical issues and problems, and 
		develops the fundamental skills necessary to the practice of the historian’s craft. It 
		allows a level of specialization that promotes an appreciation of the complexity of 
		human affairs and the difficulties involved in their interpretation. The history major 
		challenges the intellect, inspires the imagination, and stimulates analytical thinking. 
		Historical knowledge provides a valuable background for students considering careers 
		in law, journalism, library and museum work, education, business, and local, state, 
		national, and international public service. Students of history contribute anywhere that a 
		knowledge of domestic and foreign affairs is required, and, of course, to the profession 
		of historical research and teaching. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Learning Objectives </b>
			</i>
		
		•  Demonstrate understanding in several areas of history; 
		•  Demonstrate a range of critical thinking skills transferable to a wide range of 
		careers; 
		•  Demonstrate an appreciation of the complexity of human affairs and the 
		difficulties involved in their interpretation; and 
		•  Perform research and demonstrate oral and written communication skills. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Major Requirements </b>
			</i>
		
		A minimum of 33 credit hours in history courses, excluding history courses taken to 
		meet general curriculum requirements, is required for the Bachelor of Arts in history. 
		No more than 39 credit hours may be credited toward that degree.

				<b>Minor in History </b>
			</i>
		
		A minor in history is available. Twelve credit hours must be completed in history with 
		six hours at the 3000 level or higher. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Combined Bachelor of Arts/Master of Arts Program </b>
			</i>
		
		The combined Bachelor of Arts/Master of Arts program enables highly motivated 
		students to earn a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in five years. The combined program 
		requires the same number of credits and level of work as the current Bachelor of Arts 
		and Master of Arts (thesis option) degree programs. As a result only students who enter 
		TU with an IB diploma or at least 24 hours of AP credit can reasonably be expected to 
		complete both degrees in five years. All students admitted to the combined B.A./M.A. 
		program will write a master’s thesis as part of their program of study. 
		With instructor’s permission, undergraduate students enrolled in the B.A./M.A. 
		program may take 5000 level courses listed below. 
		The typical student will apply for admission to the combined program in his or her 
		junior year. (For more information, see the <i>Graduate Bulletin</i>.) Students interested in the 
		combined B.A./M.A. should contact the graduate advisor or any faculty member of the 
		Department of History to find out more about the program.

		Students who fulfill the requirements for a major in the Department of Languages 
		acquire greater awareness of and appreciation for other cultures; develop proficiency in 
		a target language and a basic understanding of its linguistic structure; gain a deeper 
		understanding of textual analysis and literary genres, styles, and periods; engage with 
		current scholarship; and prepare themselves to participate in a global society. Majoring 
		in a language provides students with a strong pre-professional background for graduate 
		studies in the arts and humanities as well as for careers in business, teaching, and 
		government.  
		The first and second-year language courses offered by the Department of Languages 
		are designed to help students throughout the University develop intermediate-level 
		proficiency in a second language, as specified in the American Council on the Teaching 
		of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) guidelines. Students enrolled in these courses likewise 
		gain insights into other cultures. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Placement in Language Courses </b>
			</i>
		
		Prior to coming to campus to enroll, incoming students with previous classroom or life 
		experience in Chinese, French, German, or Spanish who intend to continue studying 
		the same language must take its placement exam. This policy also applies to native 
		speakers of a Romance language who intend to take courses either in their native tongue 
		or in another language taught by the department. The placement examination does not 
		grant academic credit, nor can it be used to test out of the language proficiency 
		requirement. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Delayed Proficiency Credit </b>
			</i>
		
		By petitioning the Department of Languages, students who begin their language study 
		in a course above the level of first semester and complete it with a grade of C or higher 
		receive credit for the previous course as well, up to and including fourth semester. Such 
		credit may not exceed four hours. Students with previous college, AP, or IB credit in a

				<b>Beginning and Intermediate Language Courses </b>
			</i>
		
		Students whose College requirements or personal goals include one or two years of 
		language study may select from Chinese, French, German, ancient Greek, Hebrew, 
		Latin, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. The first course in each language sequence has 
		no prerequisite and assumes no prior knowledge of the language. Each subsequent

				<b>Related Studies </b>
			</i>
		
		Courses in comparative literature are taught in English and have no prerequisites. These 
		draw from various traditions and time periods and provide strategies for relating 
		literature to such areas as psychology, philosophy, politics, cinema, and the literatures of 
		other cultures. The faculty of the Department of Languages also offers a variety of 
		courses in areas such as linguistics, classics, film studies, and women’s and gender 
		studies. Many of these are taught in English and are appropriate for students in a wide 
		range of fields. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Language Majors </b>
			</i>
		
		Major programs are offered in Chinese studies, French, German, Russian studies, and 
		Spanish. The curriculum of a language major provides a wide range of experiences 
		inside and outside the classroom. Many students combine their language major with a 
		concentration in an additional field. Such a concentration may be a minor, a certificate 
		program, or a second major. Prospective language teachers complete the major in 
		Chinese studies, French, German, Russian studies, or Spanish, along with the licensure 
		and certification requirements for grades K-12 as determined by the School of Urban 
		Education (see page 128).

		arts and to the appreciation of the fine and performing arts. The mission of the School 
		of Music is to provide its students with a professional musical education that is 
		consistent with the aims of a comprehensive university and relevant to a continually 
		changing global and technological environment, to enrich the University’s curriculum

				<b>Admission to the Music Major </b>
			</i>
		
		Students who wish to major in music in pursuit of the B.A., the B.M., or the B.M.E. 
		degrees must first audition. The audition serves two purposes. It determines both 1) 
		eligibility for admission to the music major, and 2) qualification for music grants-in-aid 
		for both prospective music majors and non-majors who wish to participate in music 
		performance groups. At the time of audition, a committee of faculty members 
		determines whether a candidate qualifies for acceptance into the music major. Students 
		who qualify to major in music through successful audition are notified in writing of 
		both their admission to the major and their financial award. Students who do not intend 
		to major in music, but who qualify for grant-in-aid, are notified in writing of both their 
		financial award and the performance expectations associated with that award. 
		Both prospective music majors and currently enrolled students seeking to add the 
		music major must perform an audition. If a student is taking lessons in the School of 
		Music, the end-of-semester jury may constitute the required audition. 
		In the event that a student does not qualify for acceptance, a member of faculty of 
		the School of Music will discuss other degree plans to be considered, or any steps that 
		could be made towards admission to the music major at a later date. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Entrance Auditions Overview</b>
			</i>
		
		Auditions for students entering as freshman are held in late January and early February 
		of each academic year. Specific audition dates may be obtained by contacting the School 
		of Music office. Students audition for faculty members in their specific performance 
		areas. For instance, pianists audition for the piano faculty; and clarinetists audition for 
		the woodwind faculty. Each audition concludes with an informal interview that gives 
		the faculty members an opportunity to learn about the student’s interests and goals. 
		Students are strongly encouraged to audition in person on the posted audition dates. 
		Alternative audition dates and times are arranged only if conflicts with posted dates are 
		unavoidable. Audition appointments may be requested by sending an email to 
		musicauditions@utulsa.edu
		 or to a faculty member in the student’s performance area. 
		Audition appointments may also be made by calling the School of Music at 918-631-
		2262.  
		The faculty in each instrumental and vocal area has specified music that is appropriate 
		for auditions. To view this repertoire, please refer to the audition information on the 
		School of Music website at

			<b>Religion </b>
		
		The study of religion is in the tradition of the liberal arts, and the program in religion at 
		The University of Tulsa stands among the other humanistic disciplines. The course of 
		study encourages a critical approach to religious texts and traditions, emphasizing 
		literary, historical, philosophical, theological, and moral inquiries. Course offerings are 
		designed to expose students to the variety of religious languages, literatures and modes 
		of inquiry. Courses are taught in the following curriculum areas: the Bible; early 
		Christian thought; medieval Christian and Jewish thought; studies in Catholicism, 
		Protestantism and Judaism; ethics and society; church-state relations; and philosophy 
		and religion. Like other degree programs in the humanities, the Bachelor of Arts in 
		religion cultivates the habits of mind one needs in order to think and write with care 
		and precision, and prepares one for graduate and professional studies. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Religion Learning Objectives </b>
			</i>
		
		•  To develop a rich understanding of theological and religious thinking, language, 
		and literature in the West; 
		•  To teach students to be attentive to the historical context of theology and religious

		presentation; and 
		•  To prepare students for future studies, graduate or professional. 
		
			<i>

		Western theology, ethics and society. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Minor in Religion </b>

		There are myriad ways in which political ideas, political institutions, and political 
		processes touch and mold our lives, but typically this dimension of society is little 
		noticed and nearly invisible when things are going well or appear normal. However, 
		when the world is in turmoil, in recession or depression, caught up in war or in need of 
		new leaders, laws, and practices, politics makes itself felt. At this moment politics 
		appears everywhere and intrudes upon everything. It emerges as the now-visible set of 
		causes that structures and establishes the tone for our collective existence together. 
		We study political science not so much because it is a science. It is a science but in 
		addition to that, it is a source for hints, suggestions, and direction that might begin to 
		explain what politics has to do with the turmoil we feel around us. We look for insight 
		into the ideas that have set the ideological agenda and for insight into the challenger 
		ideas hidden in the long history of our societies. We are on the track of insight into the 
		contingent facts of institutions and their development that could have turned out 
		differently than they did, and which may someday change again, for good or for ill. We 
		seek insight into the intersecting causes that frame conflict and cooperation, whether on 
		the global or the local scale. 
		Turmoil exposes the background machinery that creates, sustains, or destroys 
		arrangements of power and relationships of authority. It raises questions about what is 
		possible in a given space of power. It shows us why political ideals depend for their 
		realization on the times in which we live and how time both renews and erodes ideals 
		and the practices in which they are embodied. 
		Even in normal times, political insight is useful. Scientific research itself is heavily 
		indebted to the political structures that fund it and to the public opinion that supports 
		funding. We need insight into how this works. A democratic society is a wonderful 
		engine of dynamic innovation, but this very fact creates social and economic 
		instabilities. For some, precious customs are constantly under challenge and politics 
		provides insight into their conservation. For others, change is desired and analyses of 
		power and authority will enable them to establish strategies for transformation. The 
		liberties which the ideals of our society uphold require citizens who have studied their 
		meaning and place, or else they will have no traction upon on our actual lives.

		As no career is untouched by politics, political science also makes a good second 
		major and a good minor. For majors, political science is one of the grand entrances into 
		law, government service, and teaching. It is also critical for anyone who expects to join a 
		not-for-profit agency or a for-profit corporation that is impacted by domestic political 
		processes or by international events.<i>
				<b/>
			</i>
		
		
			<i>
				<b>Learning Objectives </b>
			</i>
		
		•  Students who complete the undergraduate program in political science will be able 
		to evaluate political ideas, institutions and processes within states and in a global 
		context. 
		•  Students will have an in depth knowledge of at least one of the following subfields: 
		American politics, international studies, and political and legal theory. 
		•  Students will be able to demonstrate critical thinking skills and the ability to defend 
		a thesis in written and oral format. 
		Students from the American politics subfield will be able to: 
		•  Demonstrate substantial knowledge of current political and governmental 
		structures and processes in the United States; 
		•  Explain the development of American political institutions, as well as the social, 
		cultural, and historical contexts in which they were formed; and 
		•  Comprehend the history and meaning of American political ideas, being especially 
		attentive to the ideological conflicts that have characterized our political history. 
		Students from the international studies subfield will be able to: 
		•  Demonstrate a familiarity with the main theoretical perspectives that facilitate an 
		understanding of politics within and among states; 
		•  Recognize the patterns of interaction among actors of the global community and 
		have an informed awareness of the structural, social, economic, and political factors 
		that shape those interactions; and 
		•  Understand in a comparative context the political structures, institutions, governing

		The aims of the undergraduate major in psychology are several:  
		•  To develop a scientific understanding of human behavior and experience, to 
		develop critical thinking skills; 
		•  To learn how psychological knowledge is generated; and  
		•  To apply psychological principles to the solution of human problems.  
		A student who completes the psychology curriculum receives a Bachelor of Arts or 
		Bachelor of Science degree and preparation for a career in teaching, business, or law, as 
		well as for graduate work in clinical, applied, or academic psychology. A psychology 
		minor complements any line of study. Psychology courses also contribute to a major in 
		organizational studies, a minor in early childhood intervention, and the major and minor 
		in women’s and gender studies. The Department of Psychology  is also part of two 
		interdisciplinary institutes: the Institute for Biochemical and Psychological Study of 
		Individual Differences and The University of Tulsa Institute for Trauma, Adversity, and 
		Justice. Psychology majors are encouraged to take part in activities beyond their formal 
		course work such as participating in faculty research labs and institutes, engaging in 
		independent research projects, departmental colloquia, the Psi Chi National Honor 
		Society and service learning in community settings.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Learning Objectives </b>
			</i>
		
		Students who complete the undergraduate program will demonstrate a knowledge base 
		of major experimental findings and theoretical perspectives in psychology. 
		•  Apply basic research methods, including research design, data analysis, and 
		interpretation; 
		•  Pursue post-baccalaureate education or enter the workforce; and 
		•  Apply psychological principles to personal, social, organizational, and diversity 
		issues (i.e., Identify appropriate applications of psychology in solving problems 
		such as the origins and treatment of abnormal behavior, tests and measurement, 
		and psychology-based interventions while recognizing the sociocultural contexts 
		that influence individual differences in beliefs, values, and interactions.).<i>

				<b>Requirements for the Psychology Major </b>
			</i>
		
		The Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in psychology require a total of 36 credit 
		hours in psychology, excluding those counted toward general curriculum requirements. 
		The Bachelor of Arts requires the equivalent of four semesters of foreign language. The 
		Bachelor of Science requires the equivalent of math through Calculus I and Calculus II 
		or Statistics as required in the core curriculum. At least two-thirds of these credit hours 
		must be 3000- or 4000-level courses, and no more than 39 hours in psychology may be 
		counted toward the degree. Psychology majors must earn a minimum grade of B in the 
		four foundation courses. A senior project is also required.  Options that satisfy this 
		requirement include completing a one- or two-semester research capstone, taking a fifth 
		core class, completing a 5000-level graduate course, or participating in a psychology 
		practicum experience. Given that the major allows flexibility, students are strongly urged 
		to work with their advisors to select courses in a meaningful order and in relation to 
		their own career plans. However, majors are encouraged to take foundation courses as 
		early as possible.

		The University of Tulsa offers an interdisciplinary major in Russian studies. The 
		Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Russian studies is comprised of 33 hours of course work in 
		Russian language, literature and culture, history, and politics. The major provides 
		students with a knowledge and understanding of historical and contemporary Russia, as 
		well as with the ability to use the Russian language. Students have the opportunity to 
		live and study for a summer, a semester, or a year in Russia.  
		The Woolslayer Room in Russian Studies is richly furnished with instructional 
		materials, including Russian periodicals, maps, videos and DVDs, access to satellite 
		broadcasts from Russia, and advanced computing and video projection systems. It 
		serves as the centerpiece of innovative language instruction using an approach 
		developed in Russia, as well as a resource for other courses in the program.  
		Study abroad programs in Saint Petersburg are offered through consortia with which 
		The University of Tulsa is affiliated, including CIEE and AIFS. Courses taken through 
		these programs are evaluated for transfer credit toward the major on a case-by-case 
		basis by the director. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Course Requirements  </b>
			</i>
		
		Beginning Russian (RUSS 1004 and 1014) and Intermediate Russian (RUSS 2003 and 
		2013) or the equivalent are prerequisites to the major. Of the thirty-three required hours 
		in the major, at least 21 hours must be at the upper-division level (3000 and 4000-level 
		courses); these will normally include a minimum of 12 hours in advanced Russian. In 
		addition, a 3-hour senior project on a Russia-related topic will be taken in one of the 
		participating departments.

		People spend their entire lives in social groups and networks, ranging from the family to 
		global systems. Like anthropologists, sociologists study how these groups and networks 
		work. (Sociologists focus on industrial and post-industrial societies, while 
		anthropologists are concerned with human culture in general. Psychologists, in contrast, 
		study individuals.) Developing the ability to analyze society is a core component of 
		anyone’s education and personal development, and thus the sociology major facilitates 
		any career. In addition, sociology majors may design a specific program of study in 
		preparation for graduate school, professional school (law, business, medicine), and for 
		careers in social service, government, research, consulting, teaching, or business. 
		Sociology courses also contribute to specialized certificates in African American and 
		international studies and the women’s and gender studies major. 
		The Department of Sociology offers two curriculum options: Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) 
		or Bachelor of Science (B.S.). Students should consult a sociology faculty advisor to 
		select the appropriate program.

		The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in theatre and The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in 
		musical theatre offer a core curriculum supporting the collaborative process essential to 
		the living theatre. In consultation with a department advisor, theatre students choose 
		courses leading to a general education in theatre or an emphasis within the art form. 
		The student may audition for acceptance into an area of specialization at the end of the 
		spring semester of their freshman year. Areas of specialization are acting, musical 
		theatre, design/technical theatre, stage management, playwriting, history and literature, 
		and directing. The theatre student is expected to participate fully in the production 
		aspects of the theatre program as the essential laboratory in which course work is 
		integrated with practice. 
		The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in musical theatre does not require a minor area 
		of study since this degree offers three distinct areas of concentration: acting, music, and 
		dance.  
		The Department of Theatre offers minors in theatre, musical theatre, and dance. 
		Permission of the program director is required for all minors. An audition to be 
		admitted to a minor may also be required. Minors are required to audition and 
		participate in production aspects of the program. 
		The Department of Theatre is located in Kendall Hall which houses two theatres, a 
		CAD design lab, scenery and costume shops, and a dance studio. These facilities enable 
		students to participate fully in traditional and experimental theatrical productions. The 
		third venue of the Department of Theatre, the Lorton Performance Center, contains a 
		state-of-the-art proscenium theatre where musicals, dance concerts, and plays are 
		presented. The focus of the Department focus on an undergraduate program allows the 
		serious theatre student multiple opportunities to be produced, both on the mainstage 
		and in a student-driven studio setting. Students enjoy opportunities to direct, to act in 
		major roles, to stage manage, and to design and produce original works. 
		The film studies program, described on page XX of this <i>Bulletin</i>, provides additional 
		opportunities in performance, writing, and design. 
		Non-majors are also encouraged to participate in theatre productions and to take 
		theatre courses. However, priority for placement is given to majors and minors and 
		space is limited in certain classes.

			<b>Director </b>
		
		Holly Laird, English 
		The program in women’s and gender studies at The University of Tulsa considers how 
		gender and other intersecting factors, such as race, class, culture, sexuality, and age, have 
		worked to shape the life experiences of women and men from diverse backgrounds. 
		The program analyzes the contemporary and historical factors that underlie the current 
		statuses of women and men from all parts of the world and explores the various means 
		by which people have sought to achieve equality. 
		The program’s dual emphases on interdisciplinarity and intersectionality offer 
		students analytical frameworks and methodological tools with which to understand 
		people’s life experiences, human interactions, and economic and social institutions. By 
		promoting awareness and knowledge of status-based oppression; of people’s inter-
		relationships; and of the ways in which civil rights movements throughout history have 
		struggled for equity, the program seeks to contribute to changing attitudes and practices 
		that tend to silence people’s voices or that work to devalue, marginalize, or subordinate 
		women and men’s choices and life experiences. The B.A. degree is offered in this area. 
		The women’s and gender studies program also offers a combined Bachelor of 
		Art/Master of Art degree with a 4+1 program of study. Only students who plan to 
		major in the women’s and gender studies program will be admitted into the combined 
		B.A./M.A, program. In addition to the established hours required for the undergraduate 
		major, students will be expected to complete a minimum of 30 hours of graduate course 
		work for an M.A. degree. For more information, see the <i>Graduate Bulletin</i>. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Major Requirements (30 Hours) </b>
			</i>
		
		The women’s and gender studies major requires a minimum of 30 hours of course 
		work, 6 hours in the women’s and gender studies core and 24 hours in women’s and 
		gender studies electives. Courses from at least three disciplines must be included in the 
		elective credits, and eighteen hours must be six courses at or above the 3000 level. 
		Special topics courses and other variable content courses may be counted toward 
		elective course requirements with the approval of the women’s and gender studies 
		governing board. The capstone to the major is the senior project (a College 
		requirement). 
		
			<i>
				<b>Minor in Women’s and Gender Studies (12 Hours) </b>
			</i>
		
		The women’s and gender studies minor requires a minimum of 12 hours of course 
		work. Students must complete WS 2013, WS 3113, and 6 hours in women’s and gender 
		studies electives. Courses from two disciplines must be included in the elective credits, 
		and three hours must be at or above the 3000 level. Special topics courses and other 
		variable content courses may be counted toward elective course requirements with the 
		approval of the women’s and gender studies governing board.

			<b>Certificate in Creative Writing </b>
		
		
			<b>Director </b>
		
		Michael Wright, Creative Writing, Theatre and Film 
		The certificate in creative writing provides an academic study of the art and craft of 
		expression in poetry, fiction, nonfiction and/or performance writing, as preparation for 
		either graduate school or career. 
		The creative writing certificate is interdisciplinary in that it emphasizes the importance 
		of both formal and cultural diversity towards the development of the individual's vision 
		and voice. Students will explore the art of writing in myriad genres and styles; they also 
		study the applications (and implications) of creative writing through exposure to 
		historical, cultural, and inter-media possibilities. It is imperative for the student of any 
		art form to explore variations on creativity in other disciplines. Therefore the program 
		intersects offerings in five departments within the Henry Kendall College of Arts and 
		Sciences: communication, English, film studies, languages, and theatre. Occasional 
		offerings from other disciplines/departments may be considered for credit on a case-by-
		case basis in consultation with the director of the creative writing program. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Certificate Requirements (21 hours) </b>
			</i>
		
		Students must complete 21 hours of approved course work. Reading courses (6 hours) 
		are required from two separate disciplines. One must be a 3000- or 4000-level class. In 
		addition, all students pursuing the certificate must take ENGL 2403. Reading courses 
		may be selected from offerings listed below.  
		Students may focus in one form (a maximum of three courses) and must take one 
		course in another form in addition to their area of focus (i.e., three poetry and one 
		screenwriting). Prospective students must consult with the director of the creative 
		writing program to develop a course sequence that will work best with their major and 
		other requirements. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Minor in Creative Writing (12 hours)  </b>
			</i>
		
		The minor consists of 12 hours of creative writing courses. Students who minor in 
		creative writing must take ENGL 2403. Six of the hours must be at the 3000 or 4000 
		levels. Courses must be selected from the list of creative writing courses below. Courses 
		which focus on reading only do not count toward the minor.  Specific courses will vary 
		from year to year and offerings may be added. Prospective students must consult with 
		the director of the creative writing program to develop a course sequence that will work 
		best with their major and other requirements.<b/>

		The Collins College of Business invites graduating high school seniors with exceptional 
		academic records and a spirit of intellectual curiosity to consider the University’s 
		Honors Program. The core courses in the Honors Program, listed on page 84, are 
		credited to the student’s general curriculum requirement. Research is an option, but not 
		a requirement, for Honors students. A student’s directed research is applied either as 
		elective or as major required hours. Students admitted to the Honors Program receive 
		an academic scholarship and may choose to major in any academic discipline offered by

		on page 20 of this <i>Bulletin</i> or at <i>www.utulsa.edu/academics/Honors-Program.aspx.</i>
		
		
			<i>
				<b>Internship Program </b>
			</i>
		
		Student internships are working programs jointly planned and administered by faculty 
		of the Collins College of Business and participating public or private organizations. 
		Internships provide the opportunity to reinforce knowledge of principles and concepts 
		introduced in the classroom through application in actual professional situations. The 
		program includes working arrangements with Tulsa-area organizations as well as 
		internship opportunities in international locations. 
		For the best internship opportunities and information concerning career 
		development, students should consult the Business Career Center during their freshman 
		year and their faculty advisors at the start of their junior year. Career Services will also 
		assist with opportunities for internships.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Williams Student Services Center and Business Career Center </b>
			</i>
		
		The Williams Student Services Center opened in Helmerich Hall in August 2008 to 
		better serve the students in the Collins College of Business. Academic advisors for 
		undergraduate and graduate students work alongside the Assistant Dean for Business 
		Career Services to provide academic and career advising to our students. The mission of 
		the Williams Student Services Center is to guide men and women of diverse 
		backgrounds and cultures on their educational journeys by providing academic 
		recruiting, academic and career advising, and professional skill development to help 
		them prepare for leadership in 21st Century global organizations. 
		The Business Career Center is located inside the Williams Student Services Center. 
		The Center is equipped to provide many resources for undergraduate and graduate 
		business students, including resume review, cover letter review, job search strategies, 
		interview strategies, internship information, listings of available positions, and employer 
		information. Workshops and networking events are also provided throughout the 
		academic year to meet the needs of students as they pursue careers in the business 
		world. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Applied Option  </b>
			</i>
		
		A student who selects the “Applied Option” in the Bachelor of Science in Business 
		Administration program or the Bachelor of Science in International Business and 
		Language program will apply business principles in an actual business environment 
		through a formal Collins College of Business internship. In addition to completing all 
		the requirements for the B.S.B.A. or B.S.I.B.L. degree, the student must satisfactorily 
		complete an additional one-semester or summer term internship course (BUS 4001,

		•  At least 50% of the business credit hours (other than economics) required for the 
		business degree must be completed at The University of Tulsa. 
		•  Credits earned at an AACSB-accredited program, while a student is not enrolled at

		College and University.  
		•  No transfer credit will be accepted toward the business core or major required 
		courses subsequent to enrollment at The University of Tulsa, with the following 
		exception: a maximum of six hours taken during a summer term may be transferred 
		from an AACSB-accredited program.  
		•  Acceptance of prior coursework: course content varies over time and among 
		institutions. Students who are transferring from other schools or who have had a 
		break in their degree program at The University of Tulsa must have their 
		transcripts reviewed by the Collins College of Business to determine which prior 
		courses fulfill requirements toward a degree in the College. 
		•  Final/official transfer evaluations will be based on specific program requirements 
		current at the time of a student’s first enrollment and will not necessarily apply to 
		another curriculum if the student changes majors. 
		•  After completing a total of 60 hours of college work, the Collins College of 
		Business will not accept transfer credit from community colleges or other two-year 
		colleges.

		the first two years of study, which are devoted to the Tulsa curriculum and introductory 
		business core courses. Work in the business core continues during the junior year, while

		The athletic training program is an undergraduate program accredited by the 
		Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). It is designed 
		to provide structured didactic and clinical experiences to prepare students for a career in 
		athletic training. Students are encouraged to become members of the National Athletic 
		Trainers’ Association. 
		Outcomes for the athletic training program are: 
		•  Demonstrate proficiency in the domains of athletic training as established by the 
		National Athletic Trainers’ Association, and 
		•  Demonstrate the ability to utilize evidence based practice research to analyze a 
		given situation and provide the appropriate response in clinical practice. 
		Students desiring to enter this program must complete the athletic training application 
		process, which includes submitting an application and letters of recommendation. After 
		submission of the application materials and admission to the University, the prospective 
		student will receive information about the health and safety requirements of the 
		program, which must be completed as outlined below. During the fall semester, the 
		prospective athletic training student will complete prerequisite courses, acquire a 
		minimum of 80 hours of observation experience in scheduled rotations, and sit for an 
		interview with the athletic training faculty and staff. Formal acceptance into the athletic 
		training program may be granted upon successful completion of prerequisite 
		coursework, observation hours, the interview, and other university and CAATE 
		standards. Due to the program’s clinical requirement, only a limited number of students 
		are accepted each year.

		Upon acceptance to the program, the student will progress through the sequence of 
		didactic, practicum, and clinical experience courses. Athletic training students who earn 
		less than a B in any athletic training didactic or practicum course or less than a C in any 
		foundation or clinical experience course must repeat that course. Athletic training 
		students must maintain an overall grade point average of at least 2.8 on the 4.0 scale. 
		Any student who falls below this standard or is not making progress in the athletic 
		training courses will be placed on probation for the following semester. The student will 
		be notified of their probation status in a letter from the program director. The letter will 
		also explain the progress that must be made during the subsequent semester in order to 
		be removed from probation. The student will be dismissed from the program if 
		adequate progress is not made. Petition for readmission must be made to the program 
		director. The Athletic Training Council will make readmission decisions following a 
		formal petition by the student. 
		As a part of each practicum course, the student will become proficient in the required 
		psychomotor skills. A significant amount of time will be required for the clinical 
		rotations that are part of each clinical experience class; students will be directly 
		supervised by Board of Certification, Inc., certified and Oklahoma licensed athletic 
		trainers. During the clinical experience rotations, students will complete clinical 
		proficiencies, learning-over-time evaluations, and other assignments that assess learning. 
		All students in the athletic training program must adhere to the following health and 
		safety requirements:  
		
			<b>Criminal Background Check:</b> Students are required to submit to a criminal 
		background check upon formal admission to the program as required by the contract 
		with off-campus clinical agencies. This will allow proper placement of students for off-
		campus rotations.  
		
			<b>Liability Insurance:</b> Liability insurance is required for all students who have been 
		formally accepted into the athletic training program. Insurance fees are listed under 
		Health sciences program fees on page 33 of this <i>Bulletin</i> and are automatically billed to 
		the student’s account through the Bursar’s Office. 
		
			<b>Health Requirements:</b> Prior to beginning observation experiences and yearly 
		thereafter, students must complete online training in blood-borne pathogens, HIPAA, 
		the Right to Know (OSHA communication standard), and TB prevention. During the 
		prospective semester, students are required to present proof of the following 
		immunizations and screenings to the School of Nursing: TB test (using CDC guidelines 
		for two step method or chest X-ray), measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), diphtheria, 
		tetanus, pertussis (TdaP), hepatitis B, varicella and flu. These may be done at the 
		Alexander Health Center on campus for a fee or at a private physician’s office. Students 
		who do not desire the required rubella or hepatitis B immunization must sign a waiver. 
		
			<b>Transportation and Uniforms:</b> Students are responsible for providing their own 
		transportation to off-campus clinical sites and are required to buy their own uniforms in 
		accordance with the program dress code. Some uniforms may be provided by the 
		Department of Athletics. See the <i>Athletic Training Student Handbook</i> for dress code. 
		
			<b>Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR):</b> Students must provide documentation of 
		American Heart Association Basic Life Support for Healthcare Providers certification 
		after completing ATRG 2553 and must maintain continuous certification throughout 
		the remainder of the program.

		Exercise and sports science practitioners provide health care, technique/skill 
		instruction, and performance enhancement for the physically active population. 
		Foundational knowledge for this practice is gained through study of how physical 
		activity influences the human body. Clinical skill acquisition is also a very necessary 
		component. Courses within this degree program address both areas.  
		Outcomes for the exercise and sports science program are: 
		•  Demonstrate comprehension and functional knowledge of the sciences applied 
		to human performance and exercise, 
		•  Retrieve, manage, and critically analyze data relevant to the improvement of 
		health and human performance, and 
		•  Participate as professionally prepared and responsible members of their chosen 
		profession and community. 
		Exercise and sports science graduates will be prepared to seek several entry-level 
		certifications from agencies such as the American College of Sports Medicine and the 
		National Strength and Conditioning Association. This degree also prepares students for 
		graduate studies in any one of a number of sports medicine-related fields of study. 
		Students pursuing entrance into professional allied health care programs must be 
		advised that the specific school or program might dictate additional course 
		requirements. These students are advised to obtain the most current admission 
		requirements from that school and work with their advisor in assuring all requirements 
		are met.  
		Students pursuing this degree must earn a grade of C or higher in all courses with the 
		ATRG prefix, as well as BIOL 2153, 2151, 2173, and 2171. Internship experiences have 
		prerequisite courses and enrollment requires the permission of the advisor. Any student 
		who receives a failing grade in an internship course is subject to immediate dismissal 
		from the program. Internships may not be taken simultaneously. Students pursuing 
		teacher certification must meet the School of Urban Education criteria for admission 
		into teacher education and student teaching described on page 128 of this <i>Bulletin</i>.

		Students completing this degree should be advised that the following requirements 
		must be met prior to observation or internship courses:  
		
			<b>Criminal Background Check:</b> Students are required to submit to a criminal 
		background check prior to observation or internship courses as required by the contract 
		with off-campus clinical agencies. This will allow proper placement of students for off-
		campus rotations. 
		
			<b>Liability Insurance:</b> Liability insurance is required for any student enrolled in 
		Exercise and Sports Science internship courses. Insurance fees are listed under Health 
		sciences program fees on page 33 of this <i>Bulletin</i> and are automatically billed to the 
		student’s account through the Bursar’s Office. 
		
		
			<b>Health Requirements:</b> Prior to beginning observation and internship courses and 
		yearly thereafter, students must complete online training in blood-borne pathogens, 
		HIPAA, the Right to Know (OSHA communication standard), and TB prevention. 
		Students are required to present proof of the following immunizations and screenings 
		to the School of Nursing: TB test (using CDC guidelines for two step method or chest 
		X-ray), measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (TdaP), hepatitis 
		B, varicella and flu. These may be done at the Alexander Health Center on campus for a 
		fee or at a private physician’s office. Students who do not desire the required rubella or 
		hepatitis B immunization must sign a waiver. 
		
			<b>Transportation and Uniforms:</b> Students are responsible for providing their own 
		transportation to clinical areas and are required to buy their own uniforms, in 
		accordance with the program dress code. See the <i>Exercise and Sports Science Clinical </i>
		
		
			<i>Handbook</i> for dress code.  
		
			<b>Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR):</b> Students must provide documentation of 
		American Heart Association Basic Life Support for Healthcare Providers certification 
		prior to observation or internship courses and must maintain continuous certification 
		throughout the program.

		degree in Nursing (B.S.N.). The curriculum provides a broad general education and a 
		solid professional program based on a nursing model (the Roy Adaptation Model) rich 
		in content and applicability. Our goal is to produce an educated individual who is a 
		professional nurse. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Nursing Major Learning Objectives </b>
			</i>
		
		•  To value the dignity and worth of humans by practicing legally and ethically in all 
		aspects of nursing. 
		•  To empower individuals, families, and communities by promoting the welfare of 
		local, state, and national health through nursing activities. 
		•  To utilize critical thinking, independent judgment, leadership skills, and 
		communication skills to promote achievement of optimal health. 
		•  To apply theoretical and empirical knowledge from the humanities, physical, and 
		behavioral sciences while committing to lifelong learning and ongoing professional 
		development.

				<b>Accreditation </b>
			</i>
		
		The nursing program is approved by the Oklahoma Board of Nursing. The 
		baccalaureate nursing program is accredited by the Accreditation Commission for 
		Education in Nursing, 3343 Peachtree Road NE, Suite 850, Atlanta, GA 30326. The 
		School of Nursing is a member of the National League for Nursing and the American 
		Association of Colleges of Nursing. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Applicants for Licensure </b>
			</i>
		
		Graduates of this state-approved program are eligible to apply to write the National 
		Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) for registered nurses. Applicants for 
		Oklahoma licensure must meet all state and federal requirements to hold an Oklahoma 
		license to practice nursing. In addition to completing a state-approved nursing 
		education program that meets educational requirements and successfully passing the 
		licensure examination, requirements include submission of an application for licensure, 
		a criminal history records search, and evidence of citizenship or qualified alien status. 
		Applicants for practical nurse licensure must also hold a high school diploma or a 
		graduate equivalency degree (G.E.D.) [59 O.S. §567.5 &amp; 567.6]. To be granted a license, 
		an applicant must have the legal right to be in the United States (United States Code 
		Chapter 8, Section 1621). In addition, Oklahoma law only allows a license to be issued 
		to U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, and legal permanent resident aliens. Other qualified 
		aliens may be issued a temporary license that is valid until the expiration of their visa 
		status, or if there is no expiration date, for one year. Applicants who are qualified aliens 
		must present to the Board office, in person, valid documentary evidence of:  
		1.  A valid, unexpired immigrant or nonimmigrant visa status for admission into the 
		United States;  
		2.  A pending or approved application for asylum in the United States;  
		3.  Admission into the United States in refugee status;  
		4.  A pending or approved application for temporary protected status in the United 
		States;  
		5.  Approved deferred action status; or  
		6.  A pending application for adjustment of status to legal permanent resident status 
		or conditional resident status. 
		The Board has the right to deny a license to an individual with a history of criminal 
		background, disciplinary action on any professional or occupational license or 
		certification, or judicial declaration of mental incompetence [59 O.S. §567.8]. These 
		cases are considered on an individual basis at the time application for licensure is made, 
		with the exception of felony convictions. An individual with a felony conviction cannot 
		apply for licensure for at least five years after completion of all sentencing terms, 
		including probation and suspended sentences, unless a presidential or gubernatorial 
		pardon is received [59 O.S. §567.5 &amp; 567.6]. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Admission and Progression  </b>
			</i>
		
		Once admitted to the University, students apply to the School of Nursing for admission 
		to the nursing program. As clinical spaces are limited, a competitive selection process 
		occurs during the spring semester for students who wish to enroll in fall sophomore-
		level nursing courses. International students interested in the B.S.N. must have a

		TOEFL score of 80 on the computer-based exam. Foreign college credit requires a 
		“Full Education Course-by-Course Report” by the Commission on Graduates of 
		Foreign Nursing Schools prior to admission to the School of Nursing. Advanced 
		standing may be obtained with approval of courses on college transcripts. Transfer 
		students will not be permitted to pursue a nursing major at TU if they have been 
		previously enrolled in a nursing program and were not in good standing in that nursing 
		program upon exit. Exceptions may be granted, for good reason as determined by the 
		director, based on individual situations if as part of their application a letter from the 
		dean or director of the nursing program indicates eligibility for re-admission to the prior 
		program. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Performance Standards for Admission and Progression in the Bachelor </b>
			</i>
		
		
			<i>
				<b>of Science in Nursing  </b>
			</i>
		
		The University of Tulsa is committed to compliance with Section 504 of the 
		Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. 
		Therefore, the School of Nursing at The University of Tulsa seeks to ensure that 
		qualified persons with disabilities are not denied admission or subject to discrimination 
		in admissions. 
		The Performance Standards for Admission and Progression in the Bachelor of 
		Science in Nursing establish the expectations and requisite abilities considered essential 
		for students admitted to the clinical component of the nursing program in order to 
		achieve the level of competency required for graduation and practice. These include 
		abilities in eight categories: critical thinking, interpersonal, communication, mobility, 
		motor skills, hearing, visual, and tactile.  
		It is recognized that degrees of ability vary widely among individuals. Any candidate 
		who feels that he or she may not meet the Performance Standards for Admission and 
		Progression in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing as set forth in this <i>Bulletin</i> is 
		encouraged to contact the director of the School of Nursing. Any candidate who may 
		require academic accommodations to fulfill the technical standards due to a disability is 
		encouraged to contact the Center for Student Academic Support at 918-631-2315. The 
		University of Tulsa is committed to enabling its students, by any reasonable means or 
		accommodations, to complete the course of study leading to the Bachelor of Science in 
		Nursing.  
		All students are assigned a faculty advisor to assist them in their advancement 
		through the program. Students must earn a grade of C or higher in all nursing 
		foundation courses before entering courses for which the nursing foundation course is a 
		prerequisite. The student must have a University of Tulsa cumulative grade point 
		average of at least 2.5 before entering the Level I sophomore year nursing course and in 
		order to progress to Level II junior and Level III senior nursing major courses. A 
		student who receives a grade below C in any nursing major or nursing foundation 
		course is dismissed from the program, but may reapply for admission to the program. If 
		a student leaves the nursing program for more than six semesters (excluding summers), 
		the student must retake all nursing courses beginning with the second semester 
		sophomore courses, if readmitted.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Nursing Scholarships  </b>
			</i>
		
		Grants, loans, and work-study opportunities are available through the University’s 
		Office of Student Financial Services. Scholarship funds, such as the Nettie M. Jones

		Foundation scholarships, have been established for the School of Nursing. To apply for 
		a nursing scholarship, a student must be admitted to The University of Tulsa, complete 
		the FAFSA financial aid form, and have the results sent to the University each spring 
		semester. 
		Additional funds may be awarded directly to the student for junior and senior years 
		by Tulsa-area hospitals. Students repay these additional funds by working for the 
		funding institution after graduation. Out-of-town students who plan to return home 
		after graduation should check with their local hospitals for similar financial assistance.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Advanced Standing Program for Registered Nurses  </b>
			</i>
		
		The School of Nursing has adopted the Oklahoma Nursing Articulation Model for 
		Registered Nurses. Progression is based on experience, and/or refresher course, or 
		equivalent, and accreditation of the basic nursing program. The procedure for The 
		University of Tulsa School of Nursing is to verify the following:  
		1.  Current Oklahoma licensure,  
		2.  Transcripts,  
		3.  Basic nursing program accreditation, and 
		4.  Recent employment (up to 5 years previous) or refresher course completion.  
		The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.) degree requires 125 credit hours for 
		graduation. A maximum of 37 credit hours may be earned by proficiency examinations, 
		transcript evaluation, clinical experience, and licensure. A maximum of 60 credits for 
		equivalent courses may be transferred from a two-year community/junior college. 
		Credit may be earned by transfer credit and proficiency exam for the following lower 
		division nursing courses: AHS 2122; NSG 2233, 2254, 2264, and 2273. Credit will be 
		awarded for NSG 3154, 3164, 3174, 3254, 3264, and 3274 (24 credit hours) after 
		successful completion of nursing senior courses or proficiency examination. For further 
		information, consult the director of the School of Nursing.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Upward Mobility Program for Licensed Practical Nurses  </b>
			</i>
		
		Licensed Practical Nurses may earn up to 13 credit hours through proficiency 
		examinations for NSG 2254, 2264, 2273 and AHS 2122. L.P.N. students are required to 
		take NSG 2023 in addition to the standard B.S.N. requirements. For further 
		information, consult the director of the School of Nursing.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Other Information and Requirements  </b>
			</i>
		
		Nursing students must also meet the following requirements:

				<b>Tau Beta Pi  </b>
			</i>
		
		Students in engineering or the physical sciences and other closely related fields who are 
		in the upper eighth of the junior class or the upper fifth of the senior class are eligible 
		for membership in Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honor society. Candidates must 
		also exhibit personal integrity, a range of interests within and outside of the field of 
		engineering, and an ability to adapt to a wide range of professional situations.  
		
			<b>Academic Programs  </b>
		
		
			<i>
				<b>Advanced Standing  </b>
			</i>
		
		All previous education presented to the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences for 
		advanced standing must conform to applicable University requirements and is subject to 
		the following special requirements:  
		  No more than 36 hours of advanced standing credit may apply through testing 
		(International Baccalaureate, OSSM, Advanced Placement or proficiency exam).  
		  Course credits with grades of D normally do not transfer from other schools.  
		  Upper-level engineering courses normally do not transfer from schools that are not 
		accredited by ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology).  
		  The last 45 semester hours in a degree program must be completed in residence.  
		  Final/official transfer evaluations will be based on specific balance sheets current at 
		the time of a student’s first enrollment and will not necessarily apply to another 
		curriculum if the student changes majors.  
		  International students and others who apply for advanced standing credit for 
		studies completed at foreign institutions must present certified English translations 
		of transcripts or their equivalents from all foreign institutions attended.  
		Documents and transcripts from foreign institutions are subject to individual review 
		and interpretation. It is not unusual to require international students to validate course 
		work of unknown quality by examination and to repeat courses in areas where 
		knowledge appears inadequate. Credit for work completed at a foreign institution is 
		always subject to review and reassessment because of differences in accrediting 
		practices, grading methods and customs, and course content. Such credit is normally 
		recorded as total hours of advanced standing for a specific curriculum and will not 
		necessarily apply to another curriculum.  
		Advanced standing may be granted for junior college for work up to one-half the 
		hours required for graduation from the University. Such credit should be obtained 
		before admission. Additional junior college work will be credited toward a degree from 
		the University only by permission before enrollment in courses.  
		Permission to transfer additional junior college hours will be granted only if there are 
		extenuating circumstances that prevent the student from taking a similar course at The 
		University of Tulsa. Students who want permission to transfer additional junior college 
		hours should submit a written request to the associate dean for academic affairs before 
		enrolling at a junior college. The extenuating circumstances that make the transfer of 
		the additional hours necessary should be spelled out clearly in the written request. 
		Tuition differentials, personal finances, or the fact that a course may be easier at a junior 
		college do not qualify as extenuating circumstances.

		Students who have failed a course may not subsequently take a proficiency exam as 
		replacement for that course.  
		Students who have attempted a course at The University of Tulsa may not receive 
		credit for that course from another institution.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Pass/D-F Grading  </b>
			</i>
		
		The decision to take a course on a Pass/D-F basis must be made within the first three 
		weeks of a regular semester or by the published deadlines for each summer session. 
		Changing from a letter grade to the Pass/D-F option or back to a letter grade must be 
		completed during this period. The student must obtain approval to take a course 
		Pass/D-F from the College Office of Advising. Deadlines for declaring this option are 
		not subject to change.  
		Students enrolled in the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences may complete 
		up to 18 semester hours of coursework offered by other colleges on a Pass/D-F basis, 
		but no more than 4 hours in any given semester. Engineering and science majors may 
		not take courses offered by the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences Pass/D-F. 
		Engineering and science majors may not take ENGL 1004, 1033, or 3003 Pass/D-F. 
		Engineering and science majors may not take any courses designated HON or GLSC on 
		a Pass/D-F basis. A course in the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences which is 
		graded only on a Pass/D-F basis (such as an introduction to the major) is not 
		considered part of the 18-hour total. A student on a semester Study Abroad may be 
		allowed to take more than one course Pass/D-F, subject to approvals by the Center for 
		Global Education and the College. A course previously taken for a letter grade may not 
		be repeated on a Pass/D-F basis.   
		
			<i>
				<b>Probation  </b>
			</i>
		
		In addition to the University’s probation regulations, the College of Engineering and 
		Natural Sciences has the following specific requirements:  
		  The maximum load for a student on probation is 14 semester hours during a 
		semester and seven hours during any summer session.  
		  Freshmen and sophomores on probation, and all students a grade point averages 
		lower than 2.0 at the end of their sophomore years, must repeat certain courses for 
		which a D grade is recorded during their next academic term in residence, provided 
		the courses are in the official schedule of courses for that term. Courses to be 
		repeated are specified by the student’s advisor.  
		  A grade of F in any required mathematics, science, or professional engineering 
		course requires repetition at the next opportunity while the student is in residence. 
		The advisor may require repetition of any course prerequisite to the courses failed.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Electives  </b>
			</i>
		
		Students in the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences must fulfill all relevant 
		requirements of the Tulsa curriculum described on page 18 of this <i>Bulletin</i>. In addition, 
		many curricula contain a number of elective courses. The following specific 
		requirements apply to electives and the Tulsa curriculum: 
		  Students may choose to take two semesters of a single foreign language and apply 
		them as Block I and Block II credits.

		with the following exceptions: all sections of ATRG 1991 and MUS 0021 in fall 
		semesters. In addition, no more than three one-credit-hour music courses may 
		apply toward a degree. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Double Majors/Double Degrees  </b>
			</i>
		
		Students who wish to pursue majors or degrees in two different fields may do so by 
		completing the requirements for each major. Double majors or double degrees can be 
		pursued either in one college or in two different colleges. In the latter case, permission 
		from the deans of both colleges must be obtained at the time the second major/degree 
		is declared.  
		
			<i>
				<b>5000 Level Courses  </b>
			</i>

		The Bachelor of Science in Biogeosciences (B.S.B.G.) is an interdisciplinary degree 
		program that draws on strengths in the Departments of Biological Science and 
		Geosciences. The program is intended for students that are interested in career paths in 
		the fields of environmental biogeosciences or environmental forensics, as well as 
		students who are interested in graduate programs in the biogeosciences.  
		The discipline of biogeosciences is one of the more rapidly growing academic and 
		research fields in the sciences with significant research and graduate training 
		opportunities. The degree track provides a firm foundation for graduate or advanced 
		professional study and for professional practice. Only the B.S. degree track is available 
		in the program. The degree program provides significant basis in the hard sciences as 
		well as in mathematics and statistics while incorporating the core disciplinary areas in 
		biology and geosciences with emphasis on earth systems science. Students in the 
		program are strongly encouraged to actively engage in research beginning at the 
		freshman level and continuing through the senior year. The research emphasis provides 
		a learning environment that stresses the more classical classroom and laboratory 
		approach along with the experimental and field approach to professional practice in the 
		field.  
		Students interested in the program will be assigned faculty advisors in both the 
		Department of Biological Science and the Department of Geosciences to assure that the 
		students receive the best advice for course selection.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Program Objectives </b>

		The undergraduate mission of the Department of Biological Science is to provide a 
		broad foundation in the biological principles that will permit students to successfully 
		pursue a variety of career options including academic work in a diversity of graduate and 
		professional programs.  
		The Department of Biological Science offers Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Bachelor of 
		Arts (B.A.), Master of Science (M.S.), and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees. Both 
		B.S. degrees can be part of a combined B.S./M.S. degree program. This is a five-year 
		program that upon completion results in the awarding of B.S. and M.S. degrees in 
		biology. For additional information concerning M.S., Ph.D. or the combined B.S./M.S. 
		degrees see The University of Tulsa <i>Graduate Bulletin. </i>Degree requirements are purposely 
		flexible, providing the student with career choices in biotechnology, organismic biology, 
		cellular biology, environmental biology, medicine, dentistry, medical technology, or 
		further graduate training. Course work in the major, combined with studies in the 
		University-wide Tulsa curriculum, gives the student the background required to excel in 
		writing and reasoning and to adjust to the complexity of modern society and its 
		component technologies.  
		Biological science offers a personalized departmental advising system, ease of access 
		to all professors, high quality student peers, student clubs, and research opportunities 
		for undergraduate students to work in the laboratories of faculty members. Facilities 
		include electron microscopes, equipment for studies in cellular and molecular biology, 
		immunology, genetics, and field biology. Faculty research and expertise are diverse, 
		spanning such areas as ecology and systematics, developmental biology, and molecular 
		and cellular biology.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Program Objectives  </b>
			</i>
		
		Students who complete the Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree program will 
		demonstrate skills relevant to:  
		  Science literacy. 
		  Critical thinking and communication, and 
		  Ethical reasoning.

			<i>
				<b>Health Sciences  </b>
			</i>
		
		Because of the variation and frequent changes in entrance requirements among 
		professional schools, students interested in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, 
		optometry, physical therapy, or other professional fields should obtain a pre-
		professional advisor within the Department of Biological Science as early in their college 
		careers as possible.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Nursing and Allied Health Majors </b>
			</i>
		
		Nursing, exercise and sports science, and athletic training students in consultation with a 
		nursing advisor should enroll in the sequence BIOL 2151, 2153, 2171, and 2173. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Minor Fields for Biology Majors  </b>
			</i>
		
		Biology majors may minor in any subject. However, a minor in physical sciences 
		(including inorganic/organic chemistry and physics) is strongly recommended since 
		many biology elective courses presume an understanding of basic organic chemistry and 
		most professional and graduate schools require 16 hours of chemistry, 8 hours of 
		physics, and mathematics through calculus.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Teacher Certification </b>
			</i>
		
		Students seeking secondary teacher certification in biology must also complete 
		requirements for a second major in education described under the School of Urban 
		Education beginning on page 128 of this <i>Bulletin</i>. In addition, teacher certification 
		requires proficiency in a second language at the novice level (see page 131).

		The mission of the Department of Chemical Engineering is to provide a modern, high-
		quality educational experience for all students in order to graduate chemical engineers 
		who are technically competent, creative, literate, and socially aware. The B.S. degree 
		program in chemical engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation 
		Commission of ABET, 
		
			<i>http://www.abet.org</i>
		
		. Our educational objectives are to provide a 
		foundation for successful chemical engineering careers in the petroleum, natural gas, 
		chemicals, alternative energy, environmental, materials, or biotechnology industries, and 
		for graduate studies in chemical engineering or related fields such as medicine, law, and 
		business administration. 
		The Department of Chemical Engineering offers a curriculum leading to the 
		traditional Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering (B.S.Ch.E.) degree. A 4/1 
		program leading to both a B.S.Ch.E. degree and Master of Engineering in Chemical 
		Engineering (M.Ch.E.) degree in five years from the high school diploma is also 
		available for highly qualified students. A co-op program, where students work in an 
		approved industrial employment setting for up to three semesters during their B.S. 
		degree, is optional. Students are responsible for finding employers for the co-op 
		program and obtaining approval.  
		Students, in conjunction with their advisors, may choose elective courses that form a 
		cohesive area of specialization within chemical engineering. Current options include 
		petroleum refining, materials, pre-med, business, and environmental engineering. 
		Qualified students may also pursue undergraduate research culminating in a senior 
		research project. Students who have been admitted to the University’s Honors Program 
		may also participate in undergraduate research in chemical engineering. Exceptionally 
		well-qualified students, with their advisor’s approval, may make additional substitutions 
		in the curriculum to allow further specialization in their selected areas of interest.  
		Students interested in the 4/1 B.S.Ch.E./M.Ch.E. program are generally admitted to the 
		program at the end of their junior year of study toward the B.S.Ch.E. degree. Applicants 
		to the 4/1 program must have completed 96 hours of coursework toward the B.S. 
		degree, completed CHE 3084 and all prerequisites of CHE 3084, and have a GPA of 
		3.5 or higher. A typical schedule for the senior and final years for a student in the 4/1 
		program may be obtained at

		 by following the link to “Graduate 
		Program” or by consulting The University of Tulsa <i>Graduate Bulletin</i>.

		or biochemistry. The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree provides the opportunity to 
		develop a broad background in chemistry within the framework of a liberal arts 
		education. It is appropriate for students who wish to understand the basics but do not 
		anticipate a career as a research chemist. The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees consist 
		of courses in chemistry, physics, mathematics, writing and humanities. The curricula 
		provide a firm foundation for graduate or advanced professional study. Two degrees are 
		available: a B.S. in chemistry and a B.S. in biochemistry. With appropriate selection of 
		electives, both programs lead to a degree certified by the American Chemical Society. 
		The B.S. in chemistry can be tailored to suit interests in environmental chemistry, 
		advanced materials, applied chemistry, and health (pharmaceutical), as well as traditional 
		chemistry. The B.S. in biochemistry emphasizes chemistry and biology at the molecular 
		level. It is well suited to students who anticipate graduate work in the biochemical or 
		health sciences, or plan to pursue a professional degree program (medical or dental).  
		Both B.S. degrees can be part of a combined Bachelor of Science/Master of Science 
		(B.S./M.S.) degree program. This is a five-year program that upon completion results in 
		the awarding of B.S and M.S. degrees in chemistry or biochemistry. Undergraduate 
		students interested in this program must have at least 60 credit hours completed with a 
		grade point average of at least 3.4 in order to apply. Once admitted to the program, 
		students must take three 5000 level chemistry courses as advanced science electives 
		during their junior and senior years. For additional information concerning the 
		combined degrees see The University of Tulsa <i>Graduate Bulletin.  </i>

		Upon completion of the B.A. or B.S. program, students will have developed a set of 
		core skills which they use in approaching the fundamental concepts. These include: 
		  Conducting meaningful and successful experiments,  
		  Communicating results, 
		  Thinking critically, 
		  Acting ethically, and 
		  Extending results through lifelong learning. 
		
			<i>
				<b>Minor in Chemistry </b>
			</i>
		
		Students from other disciplines may minor in chemistry. A minor in chemistry is 
		granted when the student successfully completes General Chemistry I and II with 
		laboratories (CHEM 1011, 1013, 1021 and 1023), Organic Chemistry I and II with 
		laboratories (CHEM 3011, 3013, 3021 and 3023) plus eight credit hours of additional 
		chemistry courses at the 2000 level or above.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Teacher Certification </b>
			</i>
		
		Students seeking secondary teacher certification in chemistry must also complete 
		requirements for a second major in education described under the School of Urban 
		Education beginning on page 128 of this <i>Bulletin</i>. In addition, teacher certification 
		requires proficiency in a second language at the novice level (see page 131).

		The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers curricula leading to the 
		Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees in Electrical Engineering and in Electrical and 
		Computer Engineering. The curriculum in each degree includes a strong foundation in 
		the electrical, computer, mathematical, and physical sciences. The Electrical Engineering 
		degree has more of an emphasis in the fields related to power, electromagnetics, and 
		control. The Electrical and Computer Engineering degree emphasizes concepts related 
		to electronics and the computer engineering field. The B.S. degree program in electrical 
		engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, 
		
			<i>http://www.abet.org</i>.  
		The mission of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering is to provide 
		a modern, high quality educational experience for all of our students. We provide the 
		knowledge and principles on which electrical engineering and computer engineering are 
		founded in order to graduate engineers who are technically competent, creative, 
		articulate, and socially aware. The primary objective for the Department of Electrical 
		and Computer Engineering is to prepare graduates to engage successfully in the practice 
		of electrical engineering and/or computer engineering by obtaining employment or 
		admission to graduate school. Interested individuals are invited to visit <i>www.utulsa.edu/ee </i>
		
		for current information regarding our objectives.  
		Based on both the mission statement and the primary objective of the Department, 
		The objectives of the electrical engineering and the electrical and computer engineering 
		programs are to provide graduates with: 
		  The knowledge to meet employer needs should they choose a professional career; 
		and 
		  The knowledge to engage in advanced study should they choose to continue their 
		education.

		The Department of Geosciences offers Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Bachelor of Arts 
		(B.A.) degree programs in geosciences.  
		
			<i>
				<b>B.S. Degree Programs  </b>
			</i>
		
		The B.S. degree programs require three semesters of mathematics in calculus and/or 
		statistics, one year of chemistry, and one year of calculus-based physics. In addition, 
		support courses in the sciences are required. Courses may not be offered every year. A 
		six-credit-hour course in field geology is required and must be taken at another 
		university. Students graduating with a B.S. degree in geosciences usually enter a 
		professional career in the geosciences or further their education at the graduate level 
		before working professionally in the geosciences.  
		B.S. degree options include:  
		  Bachelor of Science in Geosciences (B.S.G.S.)- Environmental Science Option  
		  Bachelor of Science in Geosciences (B.S.G.S.) - Geology Option  
		  Bachelor of Science in Geophysics (B.S.G.P.) 
		The goals of the Bachelor of Science programs in geosciences and geophysics are to 
		provide students with critical content knowledge, and to develop their analytical skills. 
		Upon completion, students in the Bachelor of Science in Geosciences - Environmental 
		Science Option degree program will: 
		  Understand Earth systems, their impact on humans and the impact that human 
		activity can have, 
		  Develop skills to critically analyze environmental topics using quantitative methods, 
		and 
		  Synthesize interdisciplinary knowledge about environmental challenges.

		Upon completion, students in the Bachelor of Science in Geosciences - Geology 
		Option degree program will: 
		  Understand Earth systems and the relationship of geosciences to society, 
		  Learn to communicate effectively within their discipline, and 
		  Develop the ability to think spatially and temporally to quantitatively solve 
		problems. 
		Upon completion, students in the Bachelor of Science in Geophysics degree program 
		will: 
		  Acquire detailed content knowledge in geophysics, 
		  Develop quantitative problem solving skills, and 
		 
		Develop critical thinking skills.
		 
		Students are encouraged to take minors in associated technical fields. Minors in 
		mathematics, chemistry, physics, petroleum engineering and computer sciences are 
		among the many minors available. Students may also minor in areas of special interest.  
		Students in geosciences must maintain a grade point average of at least 2.0 in 
		geoscience, math, chemistry and physics classes, and an overall grade point average of at 
		least 2.0 in order to graduate. Foundation courses in geosciences include MATH 2014, 
		CHEM 1013, GEOL 1014, and PHYS 2053. Refer to the table on page 360 of this 
		
			<i>Bulletin</i> for specific GPA requirements. 
		Students in the 4+1 B.S./M.S. program will start research in their senior year. The 
		suggested sequence of courses during the 5th year will be determined by the student’s 
		graduate advisor. Students interested in this program must have at least 60 hours 
		completed with a grade point average of at least 3.5 in order to apply. Students in the 
		4+1 degree program take 9 hours of graduate courses in their fourth year, 3 to 6 hours 
		of coursework during the summer, and the remaining courses during the fifth year.  
		
			<i>
				<b>B.A. Degree Programs  </b>
			</i>
		
		The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree programs are broadly based, classical liberal arts 
		degrees that offer considerable flexibility to students interested in the earth sciences, but 
		who do not necessarily want to work in the petroleum industry or related industries. 
		The degree programs offer an excellent background in the sciences and in technology 
		while still preserving the flexibility and strength of a liberal arts education. The B.A. 
		programs offer the technical background needed to compete effectively in a changing 
		job market in a range of career paths. If free electives are selected carefully, this major 
		can provide the background necessary for entry into graduate-level studies in law, 
		geology, environmental science, environmental policy, meteorology, or business. 
		Students are encouraged to select a minor in allied fields of study to enhance their 
		educational experience.  
		B.A. degree options include:  
		  Bachelor of Arts with a Major in Earth and Environmental Sciences  
		  Bachelor of Arts with a Major in Geology  
		The goals of the Bachelor of Arts programs in geosciences are to provide students with 
		content knowledge and an understanding of interdisciplinary research and 
		communication.

		The Department of Mathematics offers degree programs in mathematics and applied 
		mathematics and provides courses in mathematics and statistics to serve the needs of all 
		students at the University. The mission of the Department of Mathematics is to provide 
		students with an understanding of mathematical knowledge, methods, and analytical 
		skills needed to pursue advanced degrees or careers requiring expertise in mathematics. 
		To that end, students will be expected to: 
		•  Demonstrate the ability to apply algebraic, geometric, calculus and higher-order 
		thinking, and statistical methods to modeling and solving real-world problems. 
		•  Use mathematical reasoning skills and formal logic to develop convincing 
		mathematical arguments.  
		•  Use computational tools to enhance mathematical thinking and understanding, to 
		solve mathematical problems, and to judge the reasonableness of the results. 
		Both a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in 
		mathematics are offered and provide the student with a sound foundation in 
		mathematics. The B.A. program encourages the study of languages, whereas the B.S. 
		program emphasizes supporting study in the physical sciences and computer science.  
		The Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics (B.S.A.M.) is offered with five 
		options: computer sciences, engineering, biomathematics, business, and education. Each 
		student must select one option and meet those requirements. The options provide a 
		field of application for the mathematics student. All options carry the same mathematics 
		requirement but differ in required supporting subjects. The applied mathematics 
		program provides a solid foundation in undergraduate mathematics in preparation for 
		graduate study or for a position in business or industry.

		The McDougall School of Petroleum Engineering offers a curriculum leading to the 
		Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering (B.S.P.E.) degree. The B.S. degree 
		program in petroleum engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation 
		Commission of ABET, <i>http://www.abet.org</i>. 
		The objective of the undergraduate program is to provide basic and applied 
		knowledge in petroleum engineering, with equal emphasis on drilling and completion, 
		production and reservoir areas using the fundamental building blocks of mathematics, 
		physical and engineering sciences.  
		Program Educational Objectives: 
		  Our alumni become compentent petroleum engineering professionals. 
		  Our alumni are able to analyze and design engineering systems, understand the 
		associated uncertainties, and evaluate the economic, environmental, and social 
		impacts. 
		  Our alumni are able to synthesize inputs from various sources, apply 
		multisciplinary fundamentals, and articulate technical concepts.  
		The basic 132-credit-hour curriculum is sufficiently flexible to allow a student to obtain 
		a minor in geosciences, chemical engineering, or mechanical engineering, or an option 
		to pursue graduate school with a few additional courses.

		The Department of Physics and Engineering Physics offers programs leading to the 
		Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees in physics, and to the 
		Bachelor of Science in Engineering Physics (B.S.E.P.) degree. All programs provide a 
		critical core understanding of physics and culminate in a two-semester senior 
		thesis/research design project.  
		The B.A. degree in physics prescribes a thorough undergraduate physics curriculum 
		while retaining flexibility to engage in a breadth of courses in the arts and sciences. 
		Students are expected to show proficiency in a second language and to complete a 
		concentration (at least 12 credit hours) in a field outside of their major. This degree 
		option is particularly well suited as part of an education or pre-medical program.  
		The B.S. degree in physics provides a strong foundation in physics and mathematics 
		in preparation for a technical or scientific career. Students pursuing the B.S. degree 
		enroll in a more rigorous set of technical classes than for the B.A. degree. The B.S. 
		degree requires two advanced special topics courses in physics. These courses have been 
		incorporated to allow students flexibility in their junior and senior years to focus on 
		specific fields of physics. The B.S. degree in physics provides a broad based technical 
		major and is very adaptable for students in pre-professional programs (medical, law, 
		etc.) and for education majors.  
		The B.S. degree program in engineering physics is accredited by the Engineering 
		Accreditation Commission of ABET, 
		
			<i>http://www.abet.org</i>
		
		. 
		The goal of the engineering physics program is to provide the training in physics and 
		engineering to prepare our students for careers in technical fields in industry, higher 
		education, and for lifelong learning. Consistent with this goal, the educational objectives 
		for the engineering physics program are to provide graduates with:  
		  The knowledge to successfully enter and complete programs of graduate study in 
		one of several engineering fields as well as in physics;  
		  The skills to be able to function as productive engineering professionals in areas 
		where traditional science and engineering disciplines overlap; and 
		  An awareness of the importance of continued professional self-development.

		Both B.S. degrees can be part of a combined Bachelor of Science/Master of Science 
		(B.S./M.S.) degree program. These are five year programs that, upon successful 
		completion, results in the awarding of B.S. and M.S. degrees in physics or B.S.E.P. and 
		M.S. degrees in engineering physics. Undergraduate students interested in this program 
		must have completed at least 60 credit hours with a grade point average of at least 3.4 to 
		apply. A typical schedule for a student in the 4+1 program can be obtained on the 
		Department of Physics and Engineering Physics website, <i>www.physics.utulsa.edu</i>.  
		
			<i>
				<b>Teacher Certification </b>
			</i>
		
		Students seeking secondary teacher certification in physics must also complete 
		requirements for a second major in education described under the School of Urban 
		Education beginning on page 128 of this <i>Bulletin</i>. In addition, teacher certification 
		requires proficiency in a second language at the novice level (see page 131). 
		
			<i>
				<b>Minor in Physics  </b>
			</i>
		
		Students from all colleges may minor in physics. The requirements for the physics 
		minor are PHYS 2053, 2051, 2063, 2061, 2073, 2071, and 3053; and at least six hours of 
		physics at the 4000 level.

		The University of Tulsa College of Law is ranked as a top 100 law school in the nation 
		by <i>U.S. News and World Report 2014 Best Graduate Schools</i> rankings. As one of the smallest 
		law schools in the country, the College of Law offers six degree programs: the Juris 
		Doctorate; an LL.M. degree in American Indian and Indigenous Law; an LL.M. degree 
		in American Law for Foreign Lawyers; an L.L.M. in Energy and Natural Resources Law; 
		an online Master of Jurisprudence in Indian Law; and an online Master of Jurisprudence 
		in Energy Law. In partnership with the Graduate School, the College of Law offers 10 
		joint J.D./master degrees, including J.D./M.A. degrees in anthropology, clinical 
		psychology, computer Science, English, history and industrial psychology; J.D./M.B.A; 
		and J.D./M.S. degrees in biological sciences, finance, and geosciences.  
		The College of Law’s J.D. program is comprehensive with a broad-based curriculum 
		but also offers specialization opportunities in sustainable energy and resource law; 
		Native American law; and health law. Students have opportunities to develop the 
		professional skills needed for transitioning into the practice of law through the Boesche 
		Legal Clinic’s Immigrant Rights Project and Family Advocacy Clinic, the Legal 
		Externship Program, the Judicial Externship Program, and the many career-building 
		programs offered by the Professional Development Office. The <i>Tulsa Law Review</i> and 
		the <i>Energy Law Journal</i> provide students with opportunities to publish articles 
		demonstrating their legal reasoning and writing skills.  
		With an enrollment of about 320 students, the College of Law offers students 
		opportunities for small class sizes, one-on-one interactions with professors, and 
		individualized career counseling. Professors and students enjoy newly-renovated 
		facilities that include state-of-the-art electronic classroom technology. Academic life is

		enriched by the College of Law’s many lectures, conferences, and programs which are 
		open to the entire Tulsa community. 
		
			<b>Mabee Legal Information Center (MLIC). </b>The Mabee Legal Information Center 
		(MLIC) holds more than 430,000 volumes and features a solid general legal collection as 
		well as specialized collections in energy and environmental law and Native American 
		law. All MLIC users have access to a vast number of law-related electronic resources, 
		including LEXIS and WESTLAW. In addition, the MLIC houses two student journal 
		offices, the Board of Advocates, and the Public Interest Board. The Utsey Family 
		Native American Law Center is a beautiful and inviting reading room featuring Native 
		American rare and primary resources and artwork representing all the Oklahoma tribes. 
		
			<b>Boesche Legal Clinic.</b> The Boesche Legal Clinic, through the Immigrant Rights 
		Project and the Lobeck Taylor Family Advocacy Clinic, operates as a law firm. Students 
		gain experience interviewing and counseling clients, negotiating with attorneys, planning 
		cases, conducting factual investigations, drafting documents, examining and preparing 
		witnesses, working with federal, state, and local government agencies, and providing 
		written and oral advocacy and community education workshops. 
		The faculty and students of the Immigrant Rights Project represent non-citizens in 
		immigration matters. Clients primarily include persons seeking asylum in the United 
		States as a result of persecution or a fear of persecution in their home countries. The 
		clinic may also represent non-citizen victims of domestic violence, unaccompanied non-
		citizen minors, or other non-citizens subject to removal and immigration detention.  
		In the Lobeck Taylor Family Advocacy Clinic, students serve the Tulsa community by 
		providing representation that increases access to justice for low-income individuals and 
		families. Clinic cases may involve legal issues related to domestic violence, housing, 
		public benefits, consumer debt, or collateral challenges that stem from clients’ 
		involvement in the criminal justice system. 
		
			<b>Price and Turpen Courtroom.</b> The Price and Turpen Courtroom, designed for the 
		future of legal instruction, includes a state-of-the art sound system, broadcast and 
		recording capabilities, videoconferencing technology, and wireless network access. The 
		room is a working courtroom and the venue for several Oklahoma civil and criminal 
		cases each year.  
		
			<b>Externships.</b> The externship program offers 2L and 3L students the opportunity to 
		earn academic credit while gaining practical client experience in the field. Students work 
		in a legal setting under the direct supervision of a licensed attorney or judge while also 
		taking a contemporaneous academic course which provides the opportunity for 
		reflection and additional substantive knowledge. Externships provide students the 
		opportunity to move from thinking like a lawyer in the classroom to thinking like a 
		lawyer in a practice setting through work on real cases and legal issues. Opportunities 
		exist in a broad range of civil and criminal litigation as well as transactional law. 
		Placements include courts, law firms, government agencies, non-profit organizations 
		and corporate legal departments. Full semester out-of-state placements are available 
		during the summers and/or the last semester of the 3L year.  
		
			<b>Sustainable Energy and Resources Law (SERL) Program.</b> The SERL Program 
		has three principal objectives: 1) offer comprehensive training in the fields of energy, 
		environmental, and natural resources law; 2) produce nationally and internationally 
		recognized scholarship and research that contributes to the public policy debate; and 3) 
		facilitate communication among the many individuals, companies, organizations, and

				<b>Global Scholars Program </b>
			</i>
		
		The Global Scholars program prepares students to engage the most pressing questions 
		facing the world today: How will population growth, migration, and urbanization impact 
		the world? What changes will we see in computation, robotics, biotechnology, and 
		nanotechnology? What will it take to support a global population of some 9.3 billion by 
		the middle of the century? What does it mean that the world is more economically 
		interdependent?  
		Global Scholars is a selective program for freshmen and sophomores from all 
		undergraduate colleges. Scholars take three interdisciplinary block courses that explore 
		the big questions currently affecting the world. One of the block courses is a faculty-led 
		summer course abroad. Global Scholars also study a foreign language, spend a semester 
		abroad, and examine global issues from the perspective of their particular major. 
		Students admitted to the Global Scholars Program are chosen by a committee made 
		up of faculty from all undergraduate colleges. Students are selected based on academic 
		credentials, letters of recommendation, and essays describing experience and/or interest 
		in global issues. Application deadlines are in the spring of each year. Visit

		The Tulsa University Faculty of Community Medicine (TUFCM) is an academic unit 
		within The University of Tulsa that supports the Tulsa School of Community Medicine 
		(TSCM). The TSCM is a medical school which is being established under joint 
		sponsorship of The University of Tulsa and the University of Oklahoma. It will draw 
		faculty from both institutions with medical science faculty largely resident at The 
		University of Tulsa (TUFCM) and clinical faculty predominantly drawn from the 
		University of Oklahoma.  
		The TUFCM is under the administrative authority of the Dean of the Graduate 
		School and Vice Provost for Research of The University of Tulsa. Faculty in TUFCM 
		will teach in the TSCM, and in that role their curriculum and supervision will be under 
		the dean of the medical school. 
		It is expected that the new medical school will accept its first students in the fall of 
		2015. The school is being established to address the need for more medical doctors in 
		Oklahoma, especially ones who work in family practice, internal medicine and pediatrics 
		in underserved rural and urban communities. The school will follow a curriculum that 
		integrates medical science and clinical experience required to earn the M.D. degree. The 
		details of accreditation, curriculum, facilities and staffing are under accelerated 
		development at the time of publication of this <i>Bulletin</i>.
