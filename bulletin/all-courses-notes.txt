Structure:
	Array of Departments
		Dept. Name ("Computer Science")
		Dept. Abbreviation ("CS")
		Array of Courses
			Course Number ("2103")
			Block (1,2,3, or 0 if not a block)
			Course Name ("Computing Ethics")
			optional array of prereqs
			optional array of coreqs
			optional ambiguous tag (either absent or true, true if the pre/corequisites are ambiguously defined)
			

*requisite arrays:
	(A or B or C) and D are prereqs would become
		"prereqs" : [
			["A", "B", "C"],
			["D"],
		]
	so it's basically an And by Or 2D array
	
	The elements in the array are the full course ID, like so: "CS 2003".
	Sometimes there are other special requirements, such as:
		"_instructor"		Instructor approval
		"_junior"			Junior standing
		"_senior"			Senior standing
		"_dept"				Departmental approval
		"_equivalent"		Used when prereqs are defined as "CS 1043 or equivalent". Note that I don't think we actually have course equivalence data yet.
		
	If you need a better example, just look at all-courses.json.
	Currently all the features above (except for the "_junior" requirement) are used.
